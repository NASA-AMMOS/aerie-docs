# Introduction

Aerie is a next-generation software framework for modeling spacecraft. It is developed by the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), and is being used for planning and operating spacecraft missions like [Europa Clipper](https://europa.nasa.gov/).

Some of the main features of Aerie include:

- A library to write mission models in the Java programming language
- A highly performant discrete-event simulator
- An embedded domain specific language (EDSL) for defining and executing goal-based scheduling rules
- An EDSL for defining and executing activity and resource constraints
- An EDSL for defining and executing activity command expansions
- An EDSL for defining sequences, and a fully-featured browser-based sequence editor
- A GraphQL API so you can easily build tools on top of Aerie
- A web-based [client application](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui)
