This document describes the upgrade instructions from `2.6.1` to `2.6.2`.

# 2.6.1 NOT RECOMMENDED
NOTE that a bug was discovered in version `2.6.2` after release. If you have not yet upgraded to `2.6.2`, you can skip this version and upgrade directly to `2.6.3` or later. If you are already using `2.6.3`, you should upgrade to `2.6.3` or later as soon as possible to avoid potential issues.
