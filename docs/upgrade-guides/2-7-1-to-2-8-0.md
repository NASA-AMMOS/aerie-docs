# 2.7.1 to 2.8.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `2.7.1` to `2.8.0`.

Aerie v2.8.0 contains significant changes to our PostgreSQL database structure, along with changes to our required environment variables and configuration. It therefore requires a different upgrade process than usual, especially if you plan to migrate your data forward to v2.8.0. Make sure to read all instructions below carefully before continuing, and please open a Github issue or ask for help in our Slack room if you have any questions.


## For Aerie End-Users
(ie. those running Aerie from the released `Deployment.zip` or the `deployment` folder in the repository)

### Changes to docker-compose configuration
Several changes have been made to the variables used in our `docker-compose.yml` config file. If you are using the supplied config as-is, you don't need to do anything - but if you are using a **modified version of this file** for your own deployment, you'll need to make some updates. You can either:

* Take a fresh copy of our `docker-compose.yml` file and recreate any modifications you made
* Or see the full detailed list of changes to the config variables at the bottom of this document, and manually apply these changes to your own version of the file.

### Changes to .env file
Several new environment variables are now required. Compare the new version of the `.env` file in the deployment directory to your existing `.env` file and copy over any new variables which are missing in your `.env`.
- existing values, especially AERIE_USERNAME, AERIE_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD, **must** remain unchanged from your previous version if you plan to migrate your data
- You must fill in (arbitrary) values for the password variables, which are left blank in the released `.env` file

## For Aerie Developers
(ie. anyone running Aerie from a cloned version of the `aerie` repository)

* Run `./gradlew clean` **before** checking out `develop` or `v2.8.0` in order to clean up old SQL files.
  - Or if you have already checked it out, run `rm -rf deployment/postgres-init-db/sql && git restore deployment/postgres-init-db/sql`
* Several new environment variables are now required. Compare the new version of `env.template` in the repository root to your existing `.env` file and copy over any new variables which are missing in your `.env`. Keep any of your existing values, and fill in (arbitrary) values for the password variables which are blank in the template.
* If you plan to migrate your data, follow the migration instructions below before running Aerie v2.8.0 for the first time
* When running v2.8.0 for the first time, make sure to rebuild the backend, and build/pull all containers, ie.:
  - `docker compose down --remove-orphans && ./gradlew assemble && docker compose up --pull always -d --build`


## For Anyone Migrating Data to v2.8.0
These instructions apply if you wish to save your data and **migrate it forward** to work with v2.8.0, whether you're a user or a developer.

### Migration Prerequisites
* Your database must already be up-to-date with the migrations from the prior release, 2.7.1. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you should upgrade and migrate to v2.7.1 **first** before continuing.
* You should have already followed one set of instructions above to modify either your `docker-compose` file or your `.env` file.
* Make sure you have the `psql` command installed and you can run it from your shell. If not:
  - Mac users can run `brew install libpq`
  - For other platforms, [download the Postgres installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download), and uncheck "PostgreSQL Server" when installing
* From the deployment folder, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have all necessary Python packages installed
* If you have ever changed the default names for the Aerie databases (`aerie_merlin`, `aerie_scheduler`, `aerie_sequencing`, `aerie_ui`) - this is no longer allowed, and you **must** rename them to their default names.

### Migration Process
1. Starting from the deployment directory, run `cd merge_aerie_db`
2. Run `./merge_db.sh -h` to list the available command line flags and see if any apply to your deployment - ie. if you are using non-default config file locations or connecting to a non-local database
3. Run `./merge_db.sh`, adding any necessary command line flags, to start the migration
4. As a precaution, your **old** databases have been preserved at this point. If the last step failed for any reason, you can safely drop the `aerie` database, troubleshoot the problem and re-run the `merge_db.sh` script
5. After the migration has run successfully, run `drop_old_dbs.sh` to drop your old databases.

Your data should now be fully migrated and ready to run Aerie v2.8.0! Note that, due to breaking changes to the mission model framework in v2.7.0, you may need to **recompile and re-upload** your mission models if you are upgrading from a version **before v2.7.0**.
