# 2.3.0 to 2.4.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `2.3.0` to `2.4.0`.

## Updated Java Version to Java 21

Mission model upgrade steps

- Update Gradle wrapper to one that supports Java 21, Gradle 8.6 is known to work
- Update the Java sourceCompatibilty/targetCompatability statements in your gradle file (e.g. gov.nasa.jpl.europa.clipper.aerie.adaptations.java-common-conventions.gradle)

Aerie running under JRE 21 can support mission models built with prior JDKs and models built under both JDK 19 and 21 were tested and run as expected
