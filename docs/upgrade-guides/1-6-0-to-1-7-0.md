# 1.6.0 to 1.7.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.6.0` to `1.7.0`.

## Hasura Authorization Enabled by Default ([#848](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/issues/848))

Authorization is now enabled by default for our Hasura API server. This requires additional environment variables to be provided when deploying Aerie. Additionally you must now pass an `authorization` header when making requests to Hasura.

- Deploying Aerie now requires setting additional secret environment variables. Please see our new [document on deploying with authentication](http://localhost:3000/aerie-docs/deployment/advanced-authentication/) for details on what variables to set and where.
- Any tools that make API requests to Hasura need to be updated to get a token from the gateway, and pass it in an `authorization` header. Instructions for how to do this can be found in our [API documentation](http://localhost:3000/aerie-docs/api/introduction/#authentication).

## New GraphQL Playground

Since Hasura now requires authorization, the Hasura Console is not accessible for non-admin users. To keep the Aerie API accessible we provide a new GraphQL playground in the gateway. Instructions for how to use it can be found in our [API documentation](http://localhost:3000/aerie-docs/api/introduction/#playground).

## 'Summary' Field Removed from Constraints ([#880](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/880))

The `summary` field has been removed from the constraint table. Any API queries that used that field need to be updated to remove it. For example, here is a query for a constraint with the `summary` field removed:

```diff
 query GetConstraint($id: Int!) {
   constraint_by_pk(id: $id) {
     definition
     description
     id
     model_id
     name
     plan_id
-    summary
   }
 }
```
