# 1.7.0 to 1.8.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.7.0` to `1.8.0`.

## Constraint Violation API Change

The check constraint API now returns a list of violations instead of a map of violations. Downstream code will need to be updated accordingly.

## Activity Presets Querying

The `activity_presets` table's object relationships were pluralized, which was confusing. The extra 's's at the end have been dropped. Concretely if querying for a preset's associated directive, `directives_applied_to` has been renamed to `directive_applied_to`, and `presets_applied` has been renamed to `preset_applied`.

## Remove Some "updated_at" Fields

The `command_dictionary` and `sequence` tables no longer have an `updated_at` field. Any downstream queries using this field will need to remove it.

## "begin_merge" and "create_merge_request" Updates

The signature of `begin_merge` and `create_merge_request` no longer take a username parameter. The value is now retrieved from the Hasura session.
