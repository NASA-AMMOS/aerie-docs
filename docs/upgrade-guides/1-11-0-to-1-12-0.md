# 1.11.0 to 1.12.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.11.0` to `1.12.0`.

## Plan Snapshot Table Changes

The `plan_snapshot` table columns have been updated. This should not be a problem for most users unless you are querying for plan snapshots directly. You can see the [latest database schema here](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/blob/v1.12.0/merlin-server/sql/merlin/tables/plan_snapshot.sql) to determine how to change your queries.
