# 1.8.0 to 1.9.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.8.0` to `1.9.0`.

## Tags Table ([#959](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/959))

There is a new `tags` table that is a global store for all tags in Aerie. Previously tags only existed on the `activity_directive` table directly. Any API call that queries for old `activity_directive.tags` needs to be updated to conform to the new API.

```diff
 query GetActivityDirectives {
   activity_directive {
     id
     name
-    tags
+    tags {
+      tag {
+        color
+        id
+        name
+      }
+    }
     type
   }
 }
```

Notice the new nested structure. This is required because `tags` is now a separate table, and we need to join behind the scenes to get the tags associated with the `activity_directive`.

To create tags via the API, you now need to write to the `tags` table. See the `insert_tags` query in our GraphQL schema. An example can be found in the [UI repo](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui/blob/e84cc96ce43d7b7bb019586907979f23b5dc1c98/src/utilities/gql.ts#L234).
