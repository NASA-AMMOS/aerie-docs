# 1.12.0 to 1.13.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.12.0` to `1.13.0`.

## Update Constraints to Use New Schema

The shape of violation responses has changed to include additional context information and allow for the implementation of rolling window constraints. The updated graphql shape to query for violations is below.

```diff
query CheckConstraints($planId: Int!) {
  constraintViolations(planId: $planId) {
-   violations
+   constraintId
+   constraintName
+   resourceIds
+   type
+   violations {
+     activityInstanceIds
+     windows {
+       end
+       start
+     }
+   }
  }
}
```
