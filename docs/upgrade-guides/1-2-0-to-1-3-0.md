## Remove Nested Seq JSON GraphQL Querying ([#716](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/716))

To query the Aerie GraphQL API for Seq JSON we provide the following four queries:

- `getSequenceSeqJson`
- `getSequenceSeqJsonBulk`
- `getUserSequenceSeqJson`
- `getUserSequenceSeqJsonBulk`

Previously to use these queries you needed to provide the explicit Seq JSON fields you wanted to query for. This was tedious when most of the time you need to query for the entire sequence. With this change we've removed that restriction, and return the entire Seq JSON document. For example here is a diff for a `getSequenceSeqJson` query:

```diff
query GetExpansionSequenceSeqJson($seqId: String!, $simulationDatasetId: Int!) {
  getSequenceSeqJson(seqId: $seqId, simulationDatasetId: $simulationDatasetId) {
    errors {
      location {
        column
        line
      }
      message
      stack
    }
+   seqJson
-   seqJson {
-     id
-     metadata
-     steps {
-       args
-       metadata
-       stem
-       time {
-         tag
-         type
-       }
-       type
-     }
-   }
    status
  }
}
```

Notice now we just include the `seqJson` field, which returns the entire Seq JSON document.

Additionally we provide the following two queries for converting Seq JSON into our EDSL:

- `getEdslForSeqJson`
- `getEdslForSeqJsonBulk`

The input type has changed from `SequenceSeqJsonInput!` to `SequenceSeqJson!`. For example:

```diff
+ query GetUserSequenceFromSeqJson($seqJson: SequenceSeqJson!) {
- query GetUserSequenceFromSeqJson($seqJson: SequenceSeqJsonInput!) {
  getEdslForSeqJson(seqJson: $seqJson)
}
```
