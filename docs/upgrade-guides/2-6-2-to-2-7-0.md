# 2.6.2 to 2.7.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `2.6.2` to `2.7.0`.

# 2.7.0 NOT RECOMMENDED
NOTE that a bug was discovered in version `2.7.0` after release. If you have not yet upgraded to `2.7.0`, you can skip this version and upgrade directly to `2.7.1` or later. If you are already using `2.7.0`, you should upgrade to `2.7.1` or later as soon as possible to avoid potential issues. More details can be found in [this Github issue](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/1401).

## Dependency changes
Some changes were made to Aerie UI dependencies. If you are running `aerie-ui` locally and have issues running the application or tests after this upgrade, try following the ["Cleaning" procedure in the Developer Guide](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui/blob/develop/docs/DEVELOPER.md#cleaning), then run `npm run build` to create a fresh build.
