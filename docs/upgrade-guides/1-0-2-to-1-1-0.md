# 1.0.2 to 1.1.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.0.2` to `1.1.0`.

## Function Signature and Type Changes

Tests that directly called `SimulationDriver.simulate(...)` has a new signature and some types have changed. See the following new signature:

```java
SimulationResults simulate(
  final MissionModel<Model> missionModel,
  final Map<ActivityDirectiveId, ActivityDirective> schedule,
  final Instant startTime,
  final Duration planDuration,
  final Duration simulationDuration
) { ... }
```

1. You need an additional `planDuration` parameter of type `Duration`.
1. The type of the `schedule` parameter has changed from `final Map<ActivityInstanceId, Pair<Duration, SerializedActivity>>` to `final Map<ActivityDirectiveId, ActivityDirective>`.
1. `ActivityInstanceId` has been renamed to `ActivityDirectiveId`.

## GraphQL Playground Removed from Gateway

The "GraphQL Playground" has been removed from the Gateway. It existed as an old artifact from switching from Apollo to Hasura and has not worked with our Hasura schema for awhile. Additionally there are many other third-party options available for exploring our GraphQL schema. If you are running Aerie locally please see the Hasura Console at [http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console). If you need a more targeted GraphQL explorer please take a look at https://altairgraphql.dev/.
