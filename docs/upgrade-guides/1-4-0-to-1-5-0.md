# 1.4.0 to 1.5.0

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.4.0` to `1.5.0`.

- `simulation_templates` no longer have start or end time fields. Existing simulation templates will lose those fields - if they are valuable, they should be saved off before running database migrations.

- The `aerie_db_migration` script has been renamed to `aerie_db_migration.py`
