# Advanced - User Role Permissions

User Roles are sets of permissions that defines how a user is a allowed to interact with the Aerie system.
By default, Aerie provides three User Roles:

- `viewer`, which can view all data
- `user`, which can view all data and perform all actions based on ownership
- `aerie_admin`, which can view all data and perform all actions

## Creating New User Roles

Should the default three not be sufficient for your deployment, it is possible to define new User Roles.

:::info
The `viewer` role is the most restricted role Aerie supports. To ensure Aerie works as expected when using your new role,
it is strongly recommended to give your role *at least* the same permissions as `viewer`.
:::

### Adding the Role to Hasura

In order to interact with the Aerie system, a role must first be provided access via the [Hasura Metadata](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/tree/develop/deployment/hasura/metadata).

There are three parts of the Hasura Metadata that a role needs to be added to:
Functions, Actions, and individual tables. The Hasura Metadata can be found in `hasura/metadata`.

#### Function Permissions

Function Permissions can be found in `databases/<DATABASE_NAME>/functions/functions.yaml`.
Currently, all functions are in the AerieMerlin Database.
The inside of a `functions.yaml` will look like a sequence of entries in the following pattern:

```yaml
- function:
    name: <function_name>
    schema: hasura_functions
  configuration:
    custom_root_fields:
      function: <GQL_function_name>
    session_argument: hasura_session
  permissions:
    - role: aerie_admin
```

To give the new role permission to see a given Function,
you must add them to the list of roles listed under the `permissions` key, like so:

```yaml
  permissions:
    - role: aerie_admin
    - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
```

#### Action Permissions

Action permissions can be found in `actions.yaml`. Similar to Functions, the file will be a series of entries.
The pattern for these entries is:

```yaml
  - name: <GQL_action_name>
    definition:
      kind: synchronous
      handler: "<action_endpoint>"
      timeout: 300
    permissions:
      - role: aerie_admin
      - role: user
```

To give a role permission to see an Action, add them to the list of roles under the `permissions` key:

```yaml
    permissions:
      - role: aerie_admin
      - role: user
      - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
```

#### Table Permissions

Table permissions are specified per table and can be found under `databases/<DATABASE_NAME>/tables`.

There are four permissions that may be specified for a role on a table: Select, Insert, Update, and Delete.
The follow section goes over how to configure these permissions.
More information on [configuring table permissions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authorization/permissions/)
and [the YAML syntax](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/api-reference/syntax-defs/#insertpermission) may be found in the Hasura Docs.

##### Select Permissions:
- `columns` determines which fields a role can see on all rows it can read. It is generally expected that all roles can read all columns in a table, abbreviated as `'*'`.
- `filter` determines which rows a role can read. It is generally expected that all roles can read all rows in a table, represented as `{}`.
- `allow_aggregations` determines whether a role can run aggregation functions, such as `count` or `max` on parts of the table it can read.

Example Select Permission:
```yaml
select_permissions:
  - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
    permission:
      columns: '*'
      filter: {}
      allow_aggregations: true
```

##### Insert Permissions:
- `columns` determines which fields a role can provide values for while setting a row. It is expected that `columns` includes at least those specified in the `user` role.
- `check` allows for validation of the row being inserted.
For example, `{"name":{"_like":"aerie--%"}}` means that the row being inserted must have its `name` field begin with "aerie--".
- `set` automatically sets the value of certain fields on the row to be inserted.
For example, `owner: "x-hasura-user-id"` will set `owner` as the current user's username (`"x-hasura-user-id"`).
These fields **must not** be included in `columns`.

Example Insert Permission:
```yaml
insert_permissions:
  - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
    permission:
      columns: [name, definition]
      check: {"name":{"_like":"aerie--%"}}
      set:
        owner: "x-hasura-user-id"
```

##### Update Permissions:
- `columns` determines which fields a role may update for a given row.
It is expected that `columns` includes at least those specified in the `user` role.
- `filter` determines which rows a role may update.
For example, `{"owner":{"_eq":"x-hasura-user-id"}}` means that users using the role can only delete rows
where the `owner` field is their username.
- `check` allows for validation of the updated row.
For example, `{"name":{"_like":"aerie--%"}}` means that the row must have its `name` field begin with "aerie--" after being updated.
This is optional.
- `set` automatically sets the value of certain fields on the row being updated.
For example, `updated_by: "x-hasura-user-id"` will set `owner` as the current user's username.
These fields **must not** be included in `columns`.

Example Update Permission:
```yaml
update_permissions:
  - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
    permission:
      columns: [name, owner]
      filter: {"owner":{"_eq":"x-hasura-user-id"}}
      check: {"name":{"_like":"aerie--%"}}
      set:
        updated_by: "x-hasura-user-id"
```

##### Delete Permissions:
- `filter` determines which rows a role can delete.
For example, `{"owner":{"_eq":"x-hasura-user-id"}}` means that users using the role can only delete rows
where the `owner` field is their username.

Example Delete Permission:
```yaml
delete_permissions:
  - role: <YOUR_ROLE>
    permission:
      filter: {"owner":{"_eq":"x-hasura-user-id"}}
```

### Adding the Role to the Database

Before a role can be applied to users, it must be added to the Database.

This can be done using the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation InsertUserRole {
  insert_user_roles_one(object: {
    role: "<YOUR_ROLE>",
    description: "<OPTIONAL_DESCRIPTION>"})
  {
    role
    description
  }
}
```

After adding a new role, [it is currently necessary to refresh the Hasura Metadata](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/enums/#current-limitations).
Instructions on how to do so can be found [in the Hasura Docs](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata/#reload-metadata).


#### Action and Function Permissions

In addition to the coarse-grained permissions granted by the Hasura Metadata,
certain Functions and Actions have what are known as fine-grained permissions.
For these Functions and Actions **it is not sufficient** to only allow the role
to see the function via the Hasura metadata.
This section will go over how to specify these fine-grained permissions
for a custom role.

Action and Function Permissions are represented as two JSONs, one for Actions and one for Functions.
The structure of these JSONs are `{ KEY_1: PERMISSION, KEY_2: PERMISSION, ... , KEY_N: PERMISSION }`.
The absence of a Key will be considered equivalent to a role **NOT** having permission to perform the Action or Function.

<details closed>
<summary>Values Permitted for <code>PERMISSION</code></summary>

| Permission | Meaning |
| -: | :- |
| `NO_CHECK` | The user may run the action/function with no restrictions. **The `aerie_admin` role will always be treated as having `NO_CHECK` permissions on all Actions and Functions.** |
| `OWNER` | The user must be the `owner` of **all** relevant objects **directly** used by the KEY |
| `MISSION_MODEL_OWNER` | The user must own the relevant Mission Model |
| `PLAN_OWNER` | The user must be the Owner of the relevant Plan |
| `PLAN_COLLABORATOR` | The user must be a Collaborator of the relevant Plan. **The Plan Owner is NOT considered a Collaborator of the Plan** |
| `PLAN_OWNER_COLLABORATOR` | The user must be either the Owner or a Collaborator of the relevant Plan |

In general, `OWNER` is equivalent to `PLAN_OWNER`. Exceptions are as follows:
- `apply_preset`, where `OWNER` means a user must own both the plan and the preset

#### On Plan Merge Keys

The following Function Keys are in a group known as "Plan Merge Functions" and are involved in [Plan Merging](../../planning/collaboration/merging-plans/):
`begin_merge`, `cancel_merge`, `create_merge_rq`, `commit_merge`, `deny_merge`, `get_conflicting_activities`,
`get_non_conflicting_activities`, `set_resolution`, `set_resolution_bulk`, `withdraw_merge_rq`.

Plan Merge Functions are special, as they involve multiple plans.
As such, there are special Permissions that may be used on these Keys.
Additionally, the other Permissions take on a slightly different meaning when applied to a Plan Merge Function.

A complete list of what Permissions are allowed on Plan Merge Functions follows.
Keep in mind that in a merge 'Source Plan' refers to the plan *providing* changes,
and 'Target Plan' refers to the plan *receiving* changes.

| Permission | Meaning   |
|-:|:-|
| `NO_CHECK` | The user may run the action/function with no restrictions. **The `aerie_admin` role will always be treated as having `NO_CHECK` permissions on all Plan Merge Functions.** |
| `OWNER` | The user must be the Owner of **both** Plans
| `MISSION_MODEL_OWNER` | The user must be the Owner of the relevant Mission Model
| `PLAN_OWNER` | The user must be the Owner of **either** Plan
| `PLAN_COLLABORATOR` | The user must be a Collaborator of **either** Plan. **The Plan Owner is NOT considered a Collaborator of the Plan**
| `PLAN_OWNER_COLLABORATOR` | The user must be either the Owner or a Collaborator of **either** Plan
| `PLAN_OWNER_SOURCE` | The user must be the Owner of the Source Plan.
| `PLAN_COLLABORATOR_SOURCE` | The user must be a Collaborator of the Source Plan.
| `PLAN_OWNER_COLLABORATOR_SOURCE` | The user must be either the Owner or a Collaborator of the Source Plan.
| `PLAN_OWNER_TARGET` | The user must be the Owner of the Target Plan.
| `PLAN_COLLABORATOR_TARGET` | The user must be a Collaborator of the Target Plan.
| `PLAN_OWNER_COLLABORATOR_TARGET` | The user must be either the Owner or a Collaborator of the Target Plan.

</details>

Once you have devised your Action Permissions and Function Permissions JSONs,
you can use this GraphQL Mutation to apply them to your custom role:

```graphql
mutation updateUserRolePermissions($function_permissions: jsonb!, $action_permissions: jsonb!) {
  update_user_role_permission_by_pk(
    pk_columns: {role: <YOUR_ROLE>},
    _set: {
      function_permissions: $function_permissions,
      action_permissions: $action_permissions}
  ) {
    function_permissions
    action_permissions
  }
}
```

Below are sample Query Variables. These are equivalent to the `user` role's Permissions.

```json
{
  "action_permissions": {
    "check_constraints": "PLAN_OWNER_COLLABORATOR",
    "create_expansion_rule": "NO_CHECK",

## Configuring Roles for New Users

The first time a user not in the system logs in, they will be added to the Aerie system with a set of User Roles they
are allowed to use and one Role from this set that they use by default.
By default, users will use the `user` role and have access to the `user` and `viewer` roles.
To configure this, use the `ALLOWED_ROLES` and `DEFAULT_ROLE` environment variables.
**Note: `DEFAULT_ROLE` _must_ be an entry in `ALLOWED_ROLES`.**

For more information, see the [Environment Variables document](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-gateway/blob/develop/docs/ENVIRONMENT.md) in the Gateway.

:::info When Authentication is Disabled
[If authentication is disabled](../advanced-authentication/), then the following changes apply:
1. By default, users will use the `aerie_admin` role and have access to the `aerie_admin`, `user`, and `viewer` roles
2. To configure these roles for new users, use the `ALLOWED_ROLES_NO_AUTH` and `DEFAULT_ROLES_NO_AUTH` environment variables instead.
