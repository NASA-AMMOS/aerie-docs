# Concept of Operations

## Introduction
The planning, scheduling and sequencing are common needs across many space missions, yet a common solution does not yet exist. Many space missions clone and own legacy solutions inherited from a similar, previous mission. AMMOS is dedicated to provide solutions shared across missions, liberating them from re-inventing the wheel addressing same issues and major cost of maintenance. However, the legacy AMMOS solutions pose limitations, rendering few expert users as bottleneck in the activity planning process. Aerie is designed to address the following capability gaps: 
- simplify mission modeling experience by adopting a common programming language instead of a domain specific language (DSL),
- simplify mission modeling experience by reducing interdependencies in the mission model code base, 
- allow missions to make use of existing libraries for modeling, and write custom code in their mission model as they see fit, 
- allow missions to provide a web deployment of a planning tool such that operators with limited programming skills can create valid activity plans and run simulations, 
- support real time collaboration and and parallel hypothesis testing such that many more iterations of an activity plan can be tested within the same time frame, 
- provide a low code constraint checking mechanism to validate simulation outputs which can be automated largely, 
- provide a low code scheduling mechanism that can scaffold parts of or generate complete activity plans according to goal snippets, 
- support an easy to use and verified translation from activities to flight system recognized sequences of commands. 

Note that none of the capabilities above are completely new. Different software solutions have offered pieces of the listed capabilities, simpler versions, or sometimes workarounds that missions leveraged to achieve the outcomes. Aerie's mission is to cover as many key steps in the whole activity planning and sequencing workflow in one deployed tool with dedicated components.
Although Aerie does not aim to be a complete solution for every mission, it has a strong emphasis on extensibility, customization and 3rd party tool integrations.
