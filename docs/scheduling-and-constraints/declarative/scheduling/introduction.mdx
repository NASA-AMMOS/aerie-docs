# Scheduling

This guide explains how to use the declarative scheduling service with Aerie.
The scheduling service allows you to add activities to a plan based on goals that you define (this is something called "goal based scheduling").
Declarative Goals are defined in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) provided by Aerie.

:::note

This guide assumes some very basic familiarity with programming (terminology like functions, arguments, return values, types, and objects, will not be explained), but it does not assume the reader has seen TypeScript or JavaScript before.
