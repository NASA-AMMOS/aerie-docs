# Global Conditions

It is possible to restrict the scheduler from placing activities when certain conditions are not met.
A global scheduling conditions is defined in the TypeScript EDSL (just like a Scheduling Goal), but the return type is expected to be of type `GlobalSchedulingCondition`.
These conditions, when activated, apply for **all goals**, hence the global qualification. There are several types of global scheduling conditions available described in the sections below.

## Global Condition Types

### Schedule Activities Only When

This global condition restricts when _any_ activity type can be scheduled.
This condition takes an expression of type `Windows` and prevents the scheduler from inserting any activity outside the time intervals produced by the expression when evaluated.

#### Examples

In this example, activities of any type can only be placed whenever `/plant` is lower than `10.0`:

```ts
export default function scheduleActivitiesOnlyWhenExample(): GlobalSchedulingCondition {
  return GlobalSchedulingCondition.scheduleActivitiesOnlyWhen(Real.Resource('/plant').lessThan(10.0));
}
```

### Schedule Only When

This global condition restricts when _some_ activity types can be scheduled.
This condition takes a list of activity types and an expression of type `Windows`.
It prevents the scheduler from inserting activity of the given activity types outside the time intervals produced by the expression when evaluated.

#### Examples

In this example, activities of type `BananaNap` and `BiteBanana` can be placed only when `/plant` is greater than `10.0`:

```ts
export default function scheduleOnlyWhenExample(): GlobalSchedulingCondition {
  return GlobalSchedulingCondition.scheduleOnlyWhen(
    [ActivityType.BananaNap, ActivityType.BiteBanana],
    Real.Resource('/plant').greaterThan(10.0),
  );
}
```

### Mutex

This global condition prevents activities from overlapping ([mutual exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity)).
This condition takes two lists of activity types as arguments.
It prevents the scheduler from inserting activities of the types from the first list to overlap with activities of type from the second list (and vice versa).

#### Examples

In this example, activities of types `BananaNap` and `BiteBanana` will not be allowed to overlap with activities of types `ChangeProduced` and `GrowBanana`.
But two activities of type `GrowBanana` can still overlap. And a `BananaNap` can still overlap with a `BiteBanana`.

```ts
export default function firstMutexExample(): GlobalSchedulingCondition {
  return GlobalSchedulingCondition.mutex(
    [ActivityType.BananaNap, ActivityType.BiteBanana],
    [ActivityType.ChangeProducer, ActivityType.GrowBanana],
  );
}
```

By default, two activities from the same type can overlap.
To restrict activities of a given type from overlapping with each other, it is necessary to explicitly write a mutex condition such as the following one:

```ts
export default function secondMutexExample(): GlobalSchedulingCondition {
  return GlobalSchedulingCondition.mutex([ActivityType.BiteBanana], [ActivityType.BiteBanana]);
}
```

This condition will prevent `BiteBanana` from overlapping with each other.
