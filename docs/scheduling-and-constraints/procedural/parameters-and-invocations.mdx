# Parameters & Invocations

Goals and constraints can be given arguments, much like activities can; they actually use the exact same system.
This allows you to configure a goal that needs to be reused in slightly different ways across multiple plans, or
even multiple times in the same plan.

## Parameters

:::tip

For now, only Java records are supported for parameterization.

:::

For example, we can take the example from the [scheduling](../scheduling) page, and parameterize it so that it doesn't
unconditionally recur every hour, and instead takes the period as input:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kt
Kotlin parameter mapping is not yet supported :(
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@SchedulingProcedure
public record RecurringMyActivity(Duration period) implements Goal {
  @Override
  public void run(EditablePlan plan) {
    // This produces a Booleans profile that is true at the instant of a MyActivity directive.
    final var existingActivities = plan.directives("MyActivity").active().cache();

    for (final var time: plan.totalBounds().step(period)) {
      if (!existingActivities.sample(time)) plan.create(
        "MyActivity",
        new DirectiveStart.Absolute(time),
        Map.of()
      );
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After you add the goal to your plan's scheduling specification, you'll see the goal invocation with a `period` parameter
to be filled in.

## Invocations

You can invoke the same goal multiple times in the same specification. This is useful for very specific, targeted goals;
so the above goal isn't a very practical example of multiple invocations, but that won't stop us. You can right-click on
the invocation and select "Duplicate invocation":

import duplicateInvocation from './assets/duplicate-invocation.png';

<figure>
  <img alt="Aerie Scheduling - Duplicate Invocation" src={duplicateInvocation} />
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Aerie Scheduling - Duplicate Invocation</figcaption>
</figure>

You can then create another invocation of the same goal, but likely with different parameters.
