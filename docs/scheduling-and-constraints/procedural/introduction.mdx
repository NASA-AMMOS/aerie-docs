# Procedural Scheduling & Constraints

Aerie allows users to write custom JVM procedures to check constraints or schedule new activities with complete freedom.
Most users will choose to use Java, but since the libraries are written in Kotlin, they
provide some quality-of-life improvements and syntactic sugar for those using Kotlin. Additionally, Kotlin's more intelligent
type inference, null-safety, and currying syntax make writing peripheral procedures a more seamless experience, although
the API is intended to work well with Java too.
