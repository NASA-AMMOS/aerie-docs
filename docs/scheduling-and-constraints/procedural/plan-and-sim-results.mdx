# The Plan & Simulation Results

The two main interfaces you'll query data from are `Plan` and `SimulationResults`. In constraints, they are provided as
separate objects, they are combined into one object called `EditablePlan`.

## `Plan`

The plan object contains information that defines the plan. It also provides utility functions for converting between
java `Instant` objects and our `Duration` objects, which are relative to the start of the plan.

The `plan.totalBounds()` method gives an interval that defines the extent of the plan. The whole plan might not be simulated,
but the plan bounds won't change.

### Directives

The `plan.directives(...)` methods allow you to get the activity directive timelines that define the plan.
`directives()` and `directives(type: String)` get a timeline of all directives or of just a specific activity type respectively;
and it returns them as the generic `AnyDirective` representation. If you want to use a custom representation `A`, you can call
`directives(type: String, deserializer: (SerializedValue) -> A)` and provide your own deserializer.

All directives contain an `id: ActivityDirectiveId` field, which can be used to identify a directive. These are used to
define anchored activities; the anchored activity will contain the id of the activity it anchors to. In constraints,
these ids will be the same value stored in the database, and will remain accurate after the constraint run is finished.
But in scheduling, we can only guarantee the accuracy of the id for *existing* activities; any activities you create are
given a temporary id which may change when the scheduling run ends.

Some anchored activities can't have a grounded start time, because they might be anchored to the end of an activity with
an unknown duration. But we still have to provide an estimated start time for it to be a valid object in the timeline,
so we assume the duration of the anchor target is `0`.

The directives are always up-to-date, even if the simulation results aren't.

## Simulation Results

The `SimulationResults` object contains the activity instances and resource profiles of a simulation run.

### Instances

Activity instances are the simulated version of a directive; they have a duration, a definite grounded start time
(in the case of anchored activities), and any computed attributes the activity defines, in addition to all the data
stored in the directive.

All instances have an `id: ActivityInstanceId` field, which usually, but not always matches the id of the corresponding
directive. For clarity, it also includes a `directiveId: ActivityDirectiveId?` field which *might be null*, because some
instances are spawned from other activities and don't have a corresponding directive.

You can query instances the same way as directives, using `simResults.instances(...)`.

### Resources

You can query resources with `simResults.resource("/my/resource", <deserializer>)`. Unlike activities, there is no option
to use a default deserializer; you must pick one, because it determines the profile type. Each profile type provides a
deserializer for you to use, so for example, you can get a string resource with `simResults.resource("/my/string", Strings.deserialize())`.

If you made your own data structure for your resource (say, `V`), you'll probably want to use the `Constants` profile.
But unfortunately you have to do any deserialization yourself. If you don't want to, you can just use `.resource("/my/object", Constants::new)`,
but this will return `Constants<SerializedValue>`. To do proper deserialization, call `Constants.deserialize`:
