# Constraints

:::warning

Procedural constraints aren't supported yet, although the interfaces are fully implemented. You should be able to run
a constraint locally using the procedural-remote package, but they can't yet be integrated with Aerie.

:::

It's finally time to write a useful piece of code! Constraints are simple. They take a `Plan` and `SimulationResults`,
and return a `Violations` timeline. Violations are a new type of timeline specific to constraints, that store `Violation`
objects. You won't usually need to perform additional operations after creating a `Violations` timeline; usually you'll
just return it. They can be created with some provided static constructor functions. For example:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@ConstraintProcedure
class BatteryAboveZero: Constraint {
  override fun run(plan: Plan, simResults: SimulationResults) = Violations.inside(
    plan.resource("/battery_soc", Real.deserializer()).lessThan(0).highlightTrue()
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@ConstraintProcedure
public class BatterAboveZero implements Constraint {
  @NotNull
  @Override
  public Violations run(@NotNull Plan plan, @NotNull SimulationResults simResults) {
    return Violations.inside(
      plan.resource("/battery_soc", Real.deserializer()).lessThan(0).highlightTrue()
    );
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Generator Constraints

For more complex constraints, it may be tedious to try to represent all the violations in a single `Violations` timeline,
and easier to create violations more iteratively. In this case, you could simply add to a list of violations, then
create a timeline at the end with `new Violations(violationsList)`, or you could use some helper functions provided by
the `GeneratorConstraint` abstract class instead.

:::tip

Because of Kotlin's [extension function concept](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html),
the `GeneratorConstraint` class's ergonomics are much more helpful in Kotlin, and only provides a marginal benefit in Java.

:::

For example, to violate whenever `MyActivity` occurs when `/my/resource < 0`, you could do the following:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@ConstraintProcedure
class MyConstraint: GeneratorConstraint() {
  override fun generate(plan: Plan, simResults: SimulationResults) {
    val myResource = simResults.resource("/my/resource", Real.deserializer()).cache()
    for (activity in plan.directives("MyActivity")) {
      if (myResource.sample(activity.startTime) < 0)
        violate(Violation(activity.interval))
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@ConstraintProcedure
public class MyConstraint extends GeneratorConstraint {
  @Override
  public void generate(@NotNull Plan plan, @NotNull SimulationResults simResults) {
    final var myResource = simResults.resource("/my/resource", Real.deserializer()).cache();
    for (final var activity: plan.directives("MyActivity")) {
      if (myResource.sample(activity.startTime) < 0)
        violate(Violation(activity.interval));
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Additionally, the `GeneratorConstraint` class provides some nice extension functions (all beginning with `violate...`)
that you can apply to your timelines, which convert them into violations and automatically submit them. This only works
as shown in Kotlin. You can call these functions in Java, but the syntax isn't any more ergonomic than just calling `violate(...)`
normally.

```kotlin
@ConstraintProcedure
class BatteryAboveZero: GeneratorConstraint() {
  override fun generate(plan: Plan, simResults: SimulationResults) {
    simResults.resource("/battery_soc", Real.deserializer())
      .greaterThan(0)

      // Only works in a generator constraint!
      // Only works in Kotlin!
      .violateOn(false)
  }
}
```

## Violation Messages

The `Violation` class contains a `message` field, which will display to the user in the UI. It is `null` by default,
but you have a few ways to change it.

If you're creating a `Violations` timeline, you can call `violations.withDefaultMessage(message)`, which sets the message
for those in the result that don't already have one.

If you're writing a generator constraint, you can pass it as the last argument to any `violate` call, as in
`violate(listOfViolations, messageForThisBatch)`. Or you can set a constraint-wide default by overriding the
`defaultMessage` method:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@ConstraintProcedure
class MyConstraint: GeneratorConstraint() {
  override fun defaultMessage() = "MyActivity cannot start when /my/resource < 0"

  override fun generate(plan: Plan, simResults: SimulationResults) {
    val myResource = simResults.resource("/my/resource", Real.deserializer()).cache()
    for (activity in plan.directives("MyActivity")) {
      if (myResource.sample(activity.startTime) < 0)
        violate(Violation(activity.interval))
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@ConstraintProcedure
public class MyConstraint extends GeneratorConstraint {
  @Override
  public String defaultMessage() {
    return "MyActivity cannot start when /my/resource < 0";
  }

  @Override
  public void generate(@NotNull Plan plan, @NotNull SimulationResults simResults) {
    final var myResource = simResults.resource("/my/resource", Real.deserializer()).cache();
    for (final var activity: plan.directives("MyActivity")) {
      if (myResource.sample(activity.startTime) < 0)
        violate(Violation(activity.interval));
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The order of precedence is: individual violation messages > batch violation messages > default message.
