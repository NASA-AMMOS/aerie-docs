# Common Operations

Since all timelines are just lazily-evaluated lists, there are a few low-level operations that are common to all timelines
(or all profiles) that you'll recognize from functional programming.

## Filters

There are three related families of filter-like operations available on all timelines: `filter`, `highlight`, and `isolate`,
and their derivatives. They all take a predicate, and objects not satisfying that predicate will not be included in the
output. But, the three operations do different things with the satisfying objects.

### Basic Filtering

The `.filter(predicate)` method is the simplest, and does what you'd expect: it keeps objects that satisfy the predicate,
drops those that don't, and returns a new timeline of the same type. To repeat an example from before, you can use this
to only consider activities with a certain argument:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
plan.directives("MyActivity")
  .filter {
    it.inner // this accesses the inner AnyDirective object
      .arguments.get("arg").asInt().get() == 3
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
plan.directives("MyActivity")
  .filter(
    false,
    $ -> $.inner // this accesses the inner AnyDirective object
      .arguments.get("arg").asInt().get() == 3
  )
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can filter objects by their duration with `filterByDuration`, `filterLongerThan`, and `filterShorterThan`.
These functions, through the magic of `CollectOptions.truncateMarginal`, are able to filter based on the full extent of
the object even if part of it lays outside the collection bounds (see [Collecting](../introduction#Collecting)).

Lastly, you can use `.filterByWindows(...)` to select only objects that coincide with the intervals in a `Windows` object.
This is useful when a constraint or goal needs to only apply to a certain subset of the plan, such as only during a
given mission phase.

### Highlighting

Highlighting returns a `Windows` object instead of whatever timeline type you started with. This is meant to show the
intervals of the plan where the predicate is true, when you don't care about the actual objects that satisfied the predicate.
This method always loses information; if you want to keep the satisfying object around, use `filter` or `isolate`.

Profiles provide a shorthand `.highlightEqualTo(value)` method, which does exactly what you think.

Highlighting is often used to iterate through the regions when a certain condition is met (to repeat another example):

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val myResource = plan.resource("my_resource", Real.deserializer())
for (interval in myResource.highlightEqualTo(3)) {
  // Do something with the interval
  // `interval` is JUST an interval, the original segment has been lost.
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
final var myResource = plan.resource("my_resource", Real.deserializer());
for (final var interval: myResource.highlightEqualTo(3)) {
  // Do something with the interval
  // `interval` is JUST an interval, the original segment has been lost.
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Isolating

Isolating returns a `Universal` timeline. This type hasn't been mentioned yet, since it's a more advanced topic,
but a `Universal` timeline can store any interval-like object with no specializations.

Much like an activity timeline,
`Universal` timeline objects do not coalesce if they overlap; this is why the operation is called "isolate". When applied
to a profile, where the segments interact if they overlap by either coalescing or overwriting, the satisfying segments
in the result become non-interacting.
This is the basis of [Parallel Profiles](../../advanced/parallel-profiles), and is an advanced concept that most goals
and constraints will not need.

Like `highlight`, `isolate` has shorthand for `isolateEqualTo` on profiles.

## Mapping

All timelines have a `.unsafeMap` method, which allows you to transform each object individually in any way you want.
You can use this to transform it to a new object of the same type, or convert it to a new type and store it in a different
timeline type.

It is unlikely that you'll need to directly use `unsafeMap`, since there are lots of more specific operations that delegate
to it, like:
- `unsafeMapIntervals`, which only allows you to transform the object's interval
- `shift`, which uniformly shifts the entire timeline forward or backward in time
- `mapValues` for profiles, which only allow you transform the segment's value
- many unary operations on profiles, like `.not()` for booleans, `.negate()` for numeric profiles, etc.

### Why "unsafe"?

The main contract that all timelines satisfy is that when you call `collect(bounds)`, the results returned are contained
inside the `bounds` interval. More specific timelines like profiles have additional requirements (like being sorted and
non-overlapping), but all timeline collection results must be contained within the bounds. But for performance reasons,
this requirement is usually not checked or enforced, and is only satisfied through sound algorithmic guarantees.

`unsafeMap`, and some methods that delegate to it, allow you to change the objects' intervals to whatever you want,
and potentially return a list that violates any or all of the above requirements. They are use-at-your-own-risk.

## Binary Operations

There are two generic methods provided for binary operations between two timelines, one for all timelines, and one specifically
for profiles.

### `unsafeMap2`

`unsafeMap2` and its derivatives can be applied between any two timelines, even if they are different types. It's pretty simple:
it searches for every pairing of objects in the operands that have overlapping intervals, and calls a binary function
that you provide to create a new object in the result.

It calls your binary function on every overlapping pair; meaning that if one object in the left operand overlaps with
two objects in the right operand, the function will be called with the left object twice.

A variant called `map2Values` exists just for profiles, and allows you to just worry about the values in the profile segments,
as long as you don't care about treating gaps specially.

### `map2OptionalValues`

If you do need to treat profile gaps specially, you can use `map2OptionalValues`. This method will call your binary function
whenever two segments in the operands overlap, *and* whenever a segment in one operand exists over a gap in the other. When
one operand has a gap, the value provided to your operation will be `null`. It does not call your function when both profiles
have a gap.

You can also use the `NullBinaryOperation` interface's static helper methods to create your operation with some common patterns.

## Inspection

The `.inspect` method is for when you want to observe the intermediate state of a stack of operations, for debugging, logging, or
other side effects. Keep in mind that like all operations, it doesn't run until `.collect` is called.
