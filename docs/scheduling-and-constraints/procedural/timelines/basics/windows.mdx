# Windows

`Windows` is a unique type of timeline that contains no values on each `Interval`; it is just a timeline of plain
intervals.

Originally named after the concept of "Windows of Opportunity", `Windows` essentially represents a subset of the planning
horizon. Like a profile, the intervals are automatically coalesced if they overlap.

`Windows` are usually created through the `.highlight` method or its derivatives. Its then common to either call `.collect` or
use it in a for-each loop (which calls `.collect` under the hood). For example, to iterate through the windows where the `my_resource` resource equals
`5`, you can do this:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val myResource = plan.resource("my_resource", Real.deserializer())
for (interval in myResource.highlightEqualTo(3)) {
  // do something with the interval
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
final var myResource = plan.resource("my_resource", Real.deserializer());
for (final var interval: myResource.highlightEqualTo(3)) {
  // do something with the interval
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also use a `Windows` object to filter another timeline, so that it only returns results contained in the windows.
This and the `highlight` method are explained in the [Common Operations](../common-operations) page.
