# Activities

Activity timelines are the most common type of timeline that allow the objects to overlap. In most plans, activities
of the same type won't overlap with each other, but you should never assume this in your code unless you have some
algorithmic guarantee.

There are two types of activity timelines: `Directives` and `Instances`. `Directives` are essentially the definition of
the plan before simulation, and `Instances` are the results of simulation. They both contain the arguments that you gave
them. `Directives` are instantaneous, since they haven't been simulated yet, but `Instance` objects have a duration.

## `AnyDirective` and `AnyInstance`

The activity timelines accept user-definable representations of the arguments, in their generic argument (i.e.
`Directives<MyDirectiveType>`). In the future, we will implement support for linking to the mission model and directly
using its activity types, but for now the only representations we provide are the `AnyDirective` and `AnyInstance` types.

These representations give you flexibility at the cost of ergonomics. They store the arguments as `Map<String, SerializedValue>`
(you can read about `SerializedValue` [here](/mission-modeling/activity-mappers/#what-is-a-serializedvalue)), which can be
used for any activity type.

For example, to get a timeline of `MyActivity`'s, where the `arg` argument is equal to `3`, you can do the following.
(Filtering and querying from the plan are explained more later)
