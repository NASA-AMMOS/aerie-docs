# Sampling and Caching

As a consequence of the lazy evaluation paradigm used by all timelines, each timeline is recomputed from scratch
every time `.collect()` is called on it. If you are dealing with small amounts of data and inexpensive operations, this
probably isn't a practical concern. If not, you might need to cache the timeline to improve performance.

This is very simple, just call `.cache(...)` on your timeline. It has exactly the same semantics as `.collect(...)`.
Timelines are not cached by default because if you're manipulating enough data for performance to be a concern,
storing a cache for each intermediate timeline might use too much memory.

If you explicitly call `.collect()` many times on the same timeline, it will be easy to spot the performance penalty;
but sometimes a collect call is hidden inside another operation. Let's take the code below and see how that could happen:

<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val n1 = plan.resource("int_resource_1", Numbers.deserialize())
val n2 = plan.resource("int_resource_2", Numbers.deserialize())

// Construct a very expensive profile that we should only evaluate once.
val superExpensiveProfile = n1.map2Values(n2) { l, r, _ -> ackermann(l, r) }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
final var n1 = plan.resource("int_resource_1", Numbers.deserialize());
final var n2 = plan.resource("int_resource_2", Numbers.deserialize());

// Construct a very expensive profile that we should only evaluate once.
final var expensiveProfile = n1.map2Values(n2, (l, r, _) -> ackermann(l, r));
```

</TabItem>

## Sampling

Let's say I wanted to sample the value of `expensiveProfile` at a bunch of different points, rather than using
the whole profile. You can just call `expensiveProfile.sample(myTime)`, but be careful because `sample` just delegates
to `.collect(Interval.at(myTime))` and unwraps the segment. If you only wanted to sample once, this is great, because
it avoids evaluating `expensiveProfile` for most of the plan, only calculating the one segment you need.

But if you call `.sample` many times, especially if you call it on the same segment multiple times, it will recalculate
many more times than you need. So before you do any sampling, call `cache`:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
// Say we only care about the first day of the plan.
val interval = Duration.days(0) .. duration.days(1)

// Cache the first day
expensiveProfile.cache(interval)

// Sample every 10 minutes for the first day
for (time in interval step Duration.minutes(10)) {
  val sample = expensiveProfile.sample(time)
  // do something with the sample
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Say we only care about the first day of the plan.
val interval = Interval.between(Duration.days(0), duration.days(1));

// Cache the first day
expensiveProfile.cache(interval);

// Sample every 10 minutes for the first day
for (final var time: interval.step(Duration.minutes(10))) {
  final var sample = expensiveProfile.sample(time);
  // do something with the sample
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Timeline reuse

What if `expensiveProfile` isn't the final product, and needs to be used in the construction of multiple other timelines?
In that case, any time those downstream timelines are collected, `expensiveProfile` will be recomputed too. We can avoid
this by caching it on whatever interval we are going to need it for.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
// Two intermediate profiles that both depend on `expensiveProfile`
val intermediate1 = expensiveProfile + 1
val intermediate2 = expensiveProfile * 2

// Final result profile that depends on both intermediate profiles,
// and thus transitively depends on `expensiveProfile` twice.
val result = derived1 / derived2

// If we called `result.collect()` here, expensiveProfile would be
// computed twice.

// Cache the whole profile
expensiveProfile.cache()

// Now we can collect without wasted computation
/* do something with */ result.collect()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Two intermediate profiles that both depend on `expensiveProfile`
final var intermediate1 = expensiveProfile.plus(1);
final var intermediate2 = expensiveProfile.times(2);

// Final result profile that depends on both intermediate profiles,
// and thus transitively depends on `expensiveProfile` twice.
final var result = derived1.div(derived2);

// If we called `result.collect()` here, expensiveProfile would be
// computed twice.

// Cache the whole profile
expensiveProfile.cache();

// Now we can collect without wasted computation
/* do something with */ result.collect();
```

</TabItem>

When writing procedural constraints, keep in mind that you return a `Violations` timeline which is then collected
by the driver *outside* your constraint code. So if your result depends on a timeline multiple times, that timeline will
be computed multiple times unless it is cached, even though you didn't call `.collect()` yourself.
