# External Events

External Events timelines are analogous to activity `Instances` timelines. They represent intervals with various properties that
are allowed to overlap in time and often do, even if of the same type. It is possible to access the events associated with
a plan (specifically, the events that are members of derivation groups that are associated with a plan - see
[Associating Derivation Groups](../../../../tutorials/external-events/associating-derivation-groups)).

A timeline of External Events is represented by the `ExternalEvents` class, which contains objects of the `ExternalEvent`
type. `ExternalEvent` objects have associated with them 3 attributes which can be accessed by a user:
 - the `key`,
 - the `type`, and
 - the `source`.
These are the 3 attributes necessary to uniquely identify any external event uploaded to AERIE. Unlike `Instances`,
External Events currently don't have arguments or properties, so filtration of an `ExternalEvents` object by any other
attributes is not currently possible.

A user can access the `ExternalEvents` timeline in the following way:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
plan.events()
  .filter {
    it.type.contains("A")
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
plan.events()
  .filter(
    false,
    $ -> $.type.contains("A")
  )
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above example also illustrates that one can filter an `ExternalEvents` object with high granularity by directly
accessing attributes of the contained `ExternalEvent` instances. This example filters the returned set of events to only
include those where the event type includes the string `"A"`.

## `ExternalSource`

A brief method was made to the fact that `ExternalEvent` objects have an attribute called `source`. This property is of
type `ExternalSource`, and contains the two attributes necessary to uniquely identify an external source: the `key` and
the `derivationGroupName`. To filter based on these attributes of the source of an event, once could do the following:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
plan.events()
  .filter {
    it.source.key.equals("Test.json")
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
plan.events()
  .filter(
    false,
    $ -> $.type.source.key.equals("Test.json")
  )
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

where the set of events associated with a given plan are filtered down to those from `"Test.json"`.

## `EventQuery`

explain eventquery - more easy, idiomatic way of doing what's described above without an explicit filter for common functionality of filtering by dg/type/source

example

a functionally equivalent way to do this is to get events and then call filterByX on it.
