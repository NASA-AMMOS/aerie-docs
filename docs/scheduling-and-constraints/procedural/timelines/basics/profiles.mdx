# Profiles

Profile are one of the main specializations of timelines; they represent a value changing over time. They can be used for
resources in simulation results, activity arguments, or really any function over time.

## Segments

The `Segment<V>` class is the payload object used by all profiles, and it just associates a value of any type `V` to an
`Interval`.

Segments in a profile are guaranteed to be ordered and non-overlapping. If you try to create a profile with overlapping
segments, the later segments will overwrite the earlier segments, and the earlier segments will be truncated.

## Coalescing

When two adjacent segments in a profile have the same value, they are automatically "coalesced", meaning they are replaced
with a single segment that spans both of them. So if an operation on a boolean profile produces `true` on both the intervals
`[0hr, 1hr)` and `[1hr, 2hr]`, the final result will instead contain `true` on a single segment from `[0hr, 2hr]`.

## Gaps

Resource profiles from simulation will be defined at all times, but this isn't a requirement for all profiles. If a profile
doesn't have a segment on a particular interval, that is called a "gap". The meaning of a gap often depends on context;
it could be undefined, unknown, or even `null` depending on what the profile represents.

However, since `null` is used to represent a gap during binary operations, you should not use actual explicit
`null`s inside your segments. Many operations will silently delete those segments (turning them into gaps) anyway.

Some operations will throw an error if they encounter a gap. In these cases, you can use `profile.assignGaps(...)` to
fill those gaps in, where `...` is either a value of the type `V`, or another profile of `V`s. For example,
`myBooleanProfile.assignGaps(false)` will fill in all gaps in the profile with `false`.

## Profile Types

There is no high-level `Profile` type; there are only specialized versions that need to know some information about the
data. This is because some basic operations like equality checks are impossible to define without knowing if the segments
represent piecewise-constant values or something more complex.

### Constants

If your profile is piecewise-constant, you can use `Constants<V>`. If you've created your own class to represent the data,
chances are you'll use `Constants`. This profile type will give you basic functionality such as equality checks, change
detection, and sampling, top of the higher level operations shared by all timelines.

### Booleans

`Booleans` is a further specialization of `Constants<Boolean>` that gives boolean operations like `.not()`, `.and(Booleans)`, etc.
It is often produced by comparison operations on other profiles.

Earlier versions of Aerie have conflated the concept of a boolean profile with Windows of Opportunity. In the timeline
library they are distinctly different concepts, although you can convert between them fairly easily. (See `Windows`).

### Strings

`Strings` is a similar specialization of `Constants<String>`, but doesn't give many extra operations except for
case-insensitive equality checks. Its main utility is as a parser, so you don't have to interact with `SerializedValue`
when querying resources from simulation results.

### Numbers

`Numbers<N>` is for piecewise-constant numeric profiles, where `N` is a subclass of `Number`, as in `Integer`, `Long`, etc.
You can perform basic arithmetical operations, like negation, addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation.
Unlike `Real` (see below), `Numbers` allows you to keep all precision of the data, as long as it does not vary continuously.

Additionally, you can use different numeric type for different segments if you want. `Numbers<Number>` would allow you
to use an `Integer` in one segment and a `Double` in another, if you wanted.

Unfortunately, as a limitation of the JVM's type system, the result of all binary operations between `Numbers` profiles
is always `Numbers<Number>`. As in, when you add two `Numbers<Integer>` profiles together, all the resulting segments
will contain an `Integer`, but they will be upcasted to `Number`. You haven't lost any precision, only type information.

### Real

`Real` allows you to represent piecewise-linear numeric profiles in double precision only. You can think of it as a
`Numbers<Double>` profile that includes a rate-of-change in each segment. Binary operations between `Numbers` and `Real`
profiles are supported, but unfortunately the `Numbers` profile will first be converted to doubles if necessary, which
might lose precision.
