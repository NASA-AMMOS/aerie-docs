# Basics

Timelines are used to represent all time-distributed information about a plan and simulation. They can represent resource
profiles, activities, and more, and come with operations for performing uniform global transformations easily.
If you need more fine-grained control, you can create your own operations, or unwrap the timeline entirely and work
with the underlying payload objects.

The short explanation of a timeline is a lazy bounded list of time-distributed objects. The long
explanation is the rest of this page.

## Durations

In procedural constraints/scheduling, absolute times are represented as a relative `Duration` object, centered on
the start of the plan. So, if your plan starts at midnight on January 1st, and you want to create an activity at noon
on January 2nd, you could refer to that using `Duration.hours(36)`. Alternatively, you can convert an absolute-time `java.time.Instant` to
durations and back using `plan.toRelative` and `plan.toAbsolute`, where `plan` is provided to you in the constraint or
goal interface. Durations have a resolution of microseconds and can represent any time you could reasonably want for the
next 100,000 years. They can of course be negative.

Duration constructors are provided for common units up to days, where a day is defined as 24 hours exactly, and have
no time zone information. Other timekeeping systems are possible but not directly supported, so you will need to
perform the conversions yourself.

# Intervals

`Interval`s are absolute time ranges, with start and end points represented by `Duration`s. They can include or exclude
their extremes, which is often used to represent non-overlapping segments of resource profiles. For example, the intervals
`Interval.between(hours(0), hours(1))` and `between(hours(1), hours(2))` both contain the point at 1 hour, but
`betweenClosedOpen(hours(0), hours(1))` and `between(hours(1), hours(2))` meet perfectly without overlap.

Intervals can be single points (i.e. `Interval.at(Duration.days(1))`), or even empty (`Interal.EMPTY`). Empty intervals
are any that end before they start. They are all equivalently empty, but are not equal, and some operations that assume
the interval is not empty may behave differently on unequal empty intervals.

## Interval-Like Objects

Intervals are used to represent when each object in a timeline happens. Timelines do this by requiring that their payload
objects implement the `IntervalLike` interface. Good examples are profile `Segment`s, activity `Instance`s, and of course
`Interval` itself. Any class that represents data that happens at a specific time or range of times can be made to implement
`IntervalLike`, and can be used to make a timeline.

## Collecting

Timelines are lazy, meaning that when you perform an operation on them, the operation isn't actually evaluated until you
try to access the result. This is usually done with the `collect` method, which a returns a list of your payload objects.
`collect` is usually called with an interval specifying the bounds on which it should be evaluated, so that unused results
aren't calculated. The operations are expected to return results contained in the bounds even they could return more
with no extra cost.

Any time you want to stop using timelines and directly work with the underlying data, you call `tl.collect(bounds)`
(or just `tl.collect()` for unbounded results).

By default, objects that straddle the start or end of the bounds are truncated to fit inside it. You can change this
by calling `collect` with a `CollectOptions` object as argument, and set `truncateMarginal` to `false`.
As in, `ti.collect(new CollectOptions(bounds, false))`. This will preserve the intervals of anything that is only partially
inside the bounds.

## Iterating

All timeline objects implement [`Iterable`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-iterable/),
allowing them to be used in a for loop. Keep in mind that this calls `.collect()`, which completely evaluates the timeline
into a list; it doesn't enable any proper stream-style programming.
