# Timelines

Timelines are a fundamental data structure for representing and manipulating the plan and simulation results, and they are
used everywhere in all types of procedural peripheral code. They can represent a wide variety of objects, such as
activity instances and directives, resource profiles, abstract regions of the plan, and more.

The most important feature of timelines is that you don't have to use them if you don't want to. At any time in your code,
you can unwrap a timeline using the `.collect(...)` function, which will return a list of your time-distributed objects
for you to work with manually.
