# Getting Started

Currently only scheduling procedures are supported, not constraint procedures.

## Create a project from the template

We have created a template repository for your mission model and scheduling procedures [here](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template).
If you don't already have a mission model project, you can just copy that template and follow the instructions.
If you do, you can follow these steps to add a place for your procedures:

1. Move your mission model code into a gradle subproject if it isn't already.
2. Create a `scheduling` subproject.
3. Copy the `build.gradle` from the `scheduling` subproject of the [mission model template repo](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template).
4. You can now create procedures in a java package in the `scheduling` subproject, as long as the package path ends in `procedures`.
   (i.e. `src/main/java/myorg/mymission/procedures`)

## Compiling

It is a two-part process to build your scheduling jars.
1. Run `./gradlew :scheduling:compileJava` (or any command that delegates to it, such as `:scheduling:build` or a top-level `build`).
2. Run `./gradlew :scheduling:buildAllSchedulingProcedureJars`. This produces the jar artifacts for each procedure.

There should now be one jar for each scheduling procedure, at `scheduling/build/libs/<OriginalSourceCodeFileName>.jar`.

## Creating a Goal

See the examples in the mission model template repo, or see [the scheduling page](../scheduling) in this section.
