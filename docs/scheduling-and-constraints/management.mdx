# Management

## Creating and Updating

The recommended setup is to store goals/rules/conditions/constraints (hereafter called "peripheral code")
in one or more repositories outside Aerie, and uploading
them through the UI.

For example, after creating a new goal as described in the following pages, you can upload it with the UI by selecting
`New` on the `Scheduling` option in main top-left dropdown. Or, you can upload it with an automatic association with your
plan by opening the `Scheduling Goals` pane in your plan, and navigating to `Manage Goals -> New`. Here you have the
option to either upload a JAR file, or copy-paste a typescript eDSL file.

## Model and Plan Association

In Aerie, peripherals live independently of plans and models, and can be associated with
any number of plans and models, or none at all. Each model and plan has a scheduling specification and a constraints
specification, which is simply a list of peripherals to run during the scheduling or constraints actions, respectively.

Model specifications are never run directly, and instead populate the default spec for any plans created from that model.
So if a particular constraint is widely applicable to all plans made from a particular model, you can associate it with
the model by navigating to `Models -> <select your model> -> Edit details ... -> Constraints -> Library`. Click the checkbox
on your constraint and select `Save`. Now any new plans made with this model will include your constraint in its specification.

Peripherals that don't apply to all plans for a model can be associated with individual plans too. In the main plan view,
navigate to the `Scheduling Goals` or `Constraints` pane, then click `Manage`. Click the checkbox for your peripheral and
select `Save`.

## Version Locking

Peripheral associations can be locked to a specific revision, on either the model or plan specification. In the specification,
you can change `Always use latest` to a revision number of your choice.

## Deleting

Peripherals can be deleted in the UI by navigating to the `Scheduling` or `Constraints` view in the top left, and deleting
them there. This action can't be done if the peripheral is being used by a plan or model.
