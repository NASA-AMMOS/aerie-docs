# Introduction

The Aerie API uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) via [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to allow for complex querying of **any Aerie data**. If this is your first time using GraphQL we recommend the following resources:

1. [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
1. [GraphQL Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/introduction/)
1. [Hasura Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/)

## GraphQL Schema

GraphQL uses a schema to describe the shape of available API data. Aerie employs the [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) GraphQL engine to generate the Aerie GraphQL API schema. The schema is too large to include in our documentation. If you are running Aerie locally the schema for your Aerie installation can be viewed at [http://localhost:8080/console/api/api-explorer](http://localhost:8080/console/api/api-explorer) (open the "< Docs" tab on the right).

It is important to understand the significance and power of a data-graph based API schema. Below are more detailed resources for helping yourself get familiar with the GraphQL schema and querying capabilities.

### Queries & Subscriptions

- [Postgres: GraphQL Subscriptions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/subscriptions/postgres/index/)
- [API Reference - Query / Subscription](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/api-reference/graphql-api/query/)

### Mutations

- [Postgres: GraphQL Mutations](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/mutations/postgres/index/)
- [API Reference - Mutation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/api-reference/graphql-api/mutation/)

## GraphQL Requests

A round trip usage of the API consists of the following three steps:

1. Composing a request (query, mutation, or subscription)
2. Submitting the request via an [HTTP POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) request
3. Receiving the result as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

### HTTP POST Request

A standard GraphQL HTTP POST request should use the `application/json` content type, and include a JSON-encoded body of the following form:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "operationName": "...",
  "variables": { "myVariable": "someValue" }
}
```

`operationName` and `variables` are optional fields. The `operationName` field is only required if multiple operations are present in the query.

### HTTP Response

Regardless of the method by which the query and variables are sent, the response is returned in the body of the request in JSON format. A queryâ€™s results may include some data and some errors, and those are returned in a JSON object of the form:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": []
}
```

If there were no errors returned, the `"errors"` field is not present in the response. If no data is returned, the `"data"` field is only included if the error occurred during execution.

## Authentication

To interact with the API you need to be authenticated. For each request Hasura requires an [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) to be set, which contains a token in the [bearer format](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/jwt/#hasura-jwt-format): `"Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`. To get a token you can make an HTTP request to the gateway with your credentials either using the gateway UI, or an HTTP library of your choosing. If you are using Aerie locally you can just use the admin password and skip using a token.

### Gateway UI

To get a token from the gateway UI you can visit [http://localhost:9000/#/Auth/post_auth_login](http://localhost:9000/#/Auth/post_auth_login), and enter your JPL username and password (change `localhost` do your deployment URL if you are running Aerie on a different domain).

<figure>
  <img alt="Aerie Gateway UI - Auth Login" src={gatewayAuthLogin} />
  <figcaption align="center">Figure 1: Aerie Gateway UI - Auth Login</figcaption>
</figure>

The JSON response contains a token, which you can use in the `Authorization` request header in downstream tools to query Hasura.

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "success": true,
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

### Python

You can also query the gateway from Python using HTTP to obtain a token.

```python
import json
import requests

# Query the gateway to get a token.
response = requests.post(
  url='http://localhost:9000/auth/login', # Change from 'localhost' as needed.
  json={ 'username': 'YOUR_USERNAME_HERE', 'password': 'YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE' }
)

# Grab the token from the gateway response and strip quotes.
token = json.dumps(response.json().get('token')).strip("\"")

# Print the token in Bearer format.
# You can copy and paste this into the 'Authorization' header for Hasura requests.
print(f'Bearer {token}')
```

### Admin Mode

If you are using Aerie locally, or have the [admin secret](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference/#admin-secret-key), you can query Hasura without a token and instead set the [x-hasura-admin-secret](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/admin-secret-access/) header. This allows you to skip querying the gateway for a token.

## GraphQL Clients

Since a GraphQL API has more underlying structure than a REST API, there are a range of methods by which a client application may choose to interact with the API. A simple usage could use the [curl](https://curl.se/) command line tool, whereas a full featured web application may integrate a more powerful client library like [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) or [Relay](https://relay.dev/) which automatically handle query building, batching and caching.

### Command Line

One may build and send a query or mutation via any means that enable an HTTP POST request to be made against the API. For example, this can be easily done using the command line tool [graphqurl](https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl).

### GraphQL Playground

Aerie provides an API playground via the [Altair](https://altairgraphql.dev/) GraphQL client. You can use the playground user interface to query the Aerie API directly. It is a great way to start exploring Aerie data and get familiar with GraphQL. If you are running Aerie locally you can view the playground (via the gateway server) at [http://localhost:9000/api-playground/](http://localhost:9000/api-playground/) (change the `localhost` domain as needed).

:::info

Previously our recommendation was to use the Hasura Console to explore the Aerie API. As of Aerie `1.7.0` the Hasura Console requires the admin password to access, which makes it unavailable to most for non-local use cases.

:::

To use the API playground you need to set the proper authorization header (either `Authorization` or `x-hasura-admin-secret` - see the [Authentication section above](#authentication)). Here is an example on how to set either one in the playground:

<figure>
  <img alt="Aerie API Playground - Altair Authorization Headers" src={apiPlaygroundHeaders} />
  <figcaption align="center">Figure 3: Aerie API Playground - Altair Authorization Headers</figcaption>
</figure>

### Python

You can query the API using an HTTP request in Python. Here is a simple example querying for plan data:

```python
import json
import requests

response = requests.post(
  url='http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql',
  headers={ 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' }, # See 'Authorization' section above to get this.
  json={ 'query': 'query { plan { id } }' }
)

print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

If you have the admin password you can just use it to make your request. Set the `x-hasura-admin-secret` header (default admin password shown below):

```python
headers={ 'x-hasura-admin-secret': 'aerie' }
```

### Browser Developer Console

Requests can also be tested using JavaScript from a web-browser (or Node.js). For example the following JavaScript can be used to make a simple query using the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API):

```js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql', {
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: 'query { plan { id } }' }),
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`, // See the 'Authentication' section above to get this.
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  method: 'POST',
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

Here is an example of a possible shape of the data logged to the console:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "plans": [{ "id": 1 }, { "id": 2 }]
  }
}
```

This JavaScript can then be used as a hard-coded query within a client tool/script. For more complex and dynamic interactions with the Aerie API it is recommended to use a GraphQL client library.

### Client Libraries

When developing a full featured application that requires integration with the Aerie API it is advisable that the tool make use of one of the many powerful GraphQL client libraries like Apollo Client or Relay. These libraries provide an application functionality to manage both local and remote data, automatically handle batching, and caching.

In general, it will take more time to set up a GraphQL client. However, when building an Aerie integrated application, a client library offers significant time savings as the features of the application grow. One might choose to begin using HTTP requests as the client's API integration mechanism and later switch to a client library as the application becomes more complex.

GraphQL clients exist for the following programming languages:

- C# / .NET
- Clojurescript
- Elm
- Flutter
- Go
- Java / Android
- JavaScript
- Julia
- Kotlin
- Swift / Objective-C iOS
- Python
- R

A full description of these clients is found at [https://graphql.org/code/#language-support](https://graphql.org/code/#language-support)
