# Advanced - Extensions

## Creating an Extension

```graphql
mutation InsertExtensions($object: extensions_insert_input!) {
  insert_extensions(
    objects: { description: "", label: "My External Application", url: "https://externalapp/api/test" }
  ) {
    returning {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating an Extension Role

This is an example query that would allow the `viewer` role the ability to execute the extension with id `1`. Only defined roles will be able to call the extension through the UI.

```graphql
mutation InsertExtensionRoles($object: extension_roles_insert_input!) {
  insert_extension_roles(objects: { extension_id: 1, role: "viewer" }) {
    returning {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Deleting an Extension

The following query will delete an extension and cascade to delete any assigned roles for that extension as well.

```graphql
mutation DeleteExtension($extension_id: Int!) {
  delete_extensions_by_pk(id: $extension_id) {
    id
  }
}
```

## Get Extensions With Roles

```graphql
query GetExtensions {
  extensions {
    description
    extension_roles {
      id
      role
    }
    id
    label
    url
  }
}
```
