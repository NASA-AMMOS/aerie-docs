# Constraints

## Check Constraints

```graphql
query CheckConstraints($planId: Int!, $simulationDatasetId: Int) {
  constraintViolations(planId: $planId, simulationDatasetId: $simulationDatasetId) {
    constraintId
    constraintName
    constraintRevision
    success
    results {
      violations {
        activityInstanceIds
        windows {
          end
          start
        }
      }
      gaps {
        end
        start
      }
      resourceIds
    }
    errors {
      stack
      message
      location {
        column
        line
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Returns a list of constraint violations for a given plan by `$planId`.
The violations will include the corresponding constraint name, type, and id. An optional `$simulationDatasetId` can be provided which limits the constraint violation checking to a single simulation dataset, which is useful when external datasets are added that only reference a single simulation dataset, as constraint violations would otherwise be reported for every uploaded external dataset.

## Create Constraint

<details closed>
  <summary><b>For Aerie deployments before v2.4.0</b></summary>

  ```graphql
  mutation CreateConstraint($constraint: constraint_insert_input!) {
    insert_constraint_one(object: $constraint) {
      id
    }
  }
  ```

  The `$constraint` query variable has the following type definition:

  ```ts
  type Constraint = {
    definition: string;
    description: string;
    model_id: number | null;
    name: string;
    plan_id: number | null;
    summary: string;
  };
  ```

</details>

```graphql
mutation CreateConstraint($constraint: constraint_metadata_insert_input!) {
  insert_constraint_metadata_one(object: $constraint) {
    id
    public
    description
    versions {
      definition
    }
  }
}
```

The `$constraint` query variable has the following structure:

```json
{
  "constraint": {
    "name": string,
    "public": boolean, // Default false
    "description": string, // Optional
    "versions": {
      "data": {
        "definition": string // EDSL Code
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `public` field controls whether all users can add your constraint to their constraint specifications
or if only you can do that.
Additionally, if `public` is set to `true`, the constraint _must_ have a unique name.

The `description` field, if present, contains a human-readable description of the constraint.

The `definition` field contains your EDSL constraint code.

## Update Constraint Metadata

***Introduced in v2.4.0***

A constraint's metadata includes its name, public status, owner, and description.
In order to update a constraint's metadata, you must be either an admin user or the owner of the constraint.

```graphql
mutation UpdateConstraintMetadata($id: Int!, $constraint: constraint_set_input!) {
  update_constraint_by_pk(pk_columns: { id: $id }, _set: $constraint) {
    id
  }
}
```

The `$constraint` query variable has the same type definition as the [create constraint](#create-constraint) query above, but less strict. You can leave properties out that you do not need to update.

## Add Constraint Version

***Introduced in v2.4.0***

Constraint definitions are versioned and cannot be changed once created.

```graphql
mutation AddConstraintVersion($constraintId: Int!, $definition: String!) {
  insert_constraint_definition_one(object: {constraint_id: $constraintId, definition: $definition}) {
    revision
  }
}
```

## Delete Constraint Version

***Introduced in v2.4.0***

In order to delete a constraint version, it must not be in use on any constraint specifications (see [below](#manage-constraint-specifications)).

```graphql
mutation DeleteConstraintVersion($constraintId: Int!, $revsion: Int!) {
  delete_constraint_definition_by_pk(constraint_id: $constraintId, revision: $revsion){
    definition
  }
}
```

## Delete Constraint

<details closed>
  <summary><b>For Aerie deployments before v2.4.0</b></summary>

  ```graphql
  mutation DeleteConstraint($id: Int!) {
    delete_constraint_by_pk(id: $id) {
      id
    }
  }
  ```

</details>

In order to delete a constraint, it must not be in use on any constraint specifications (see [below](#manage-constraint-specifications)).

```graphql
mutation DeleteConstraint($id: Int!) {
  delete_constraint_metadata_by_pk(id: $id){
    id
  }
}
```

## Manage Constraint Specifications

***Introduced in v2.4.0.***

There are two types of constraint specifications in Aerie:
a **model specification** and a **plan specification**.

- A **constraint plan specification** is the set of constraints that
will be checked against the plan when you [Check Constraints](#check-constraints).
- A **constraint model specification** is used as a guideline for
the constraint specification of every plan that uses the model.
All new plans created from this model will start with their constraint
specification prepopulated with the contents of their model's constraint specification.
Note that updating a model's constraint specification will not automatically update
the constraint specification of plans using the model.

### Add Constraint to Model Specification

```graphql
mutation AddConstraintModelSpec($constraint: constraint_model_specification_insert_input!) {
  insert_constraint_model_specification_one(object: $constraint) {
    model_id
    constraint_id
    constraint_revision
  }
}
```

The `$constraint` query variable has the following structure.

```json
{
  "model_id": integer,
  "constraint_id": integer,
  "constraint_revision": integer, // optional
}
```

The `constraint_revision` field is used to specify which version of the constraint to use when checking constraints.
If absent, the latest version of the constraint will be used.

### Update Constraint Version on a Plan Specification

Excluding the revision will set the recommended version of the constraint to the latest version.

```graphql
mutation SetConstraintVersion($modelId: Int!, $constraintId: Int!, $constraintVersion: Int) {
  update_constraint_model_specification_by_pk(
    pk_columns: {model_id: $modelId, constraint_id: $constraintId},
    _set: {constraint_revision: $constraintVersion}
  ) {
    model_id
    constraint_id
    constraint_revision
  }
}
```

### Remove a Constraint from the Model Specification

```graphql
mutation RemoveConstraintFromModelSpec($modelId: Int!, $constraintId: Int!) {
  delete_constraint_model_specification_by_pk(model_id: $modelId, constraint_id: $constraintId) {
    constraint_id
  }
}
```

### Add Constraint to Plan Specification

```graphql
mutation AddConstraintPlanSpec($constraint: constraint_specification_insert_input!) {
  insert_constraint_specification_one(object: $constraint) {
    plan_id
    enabled
    constraint_id
    constraint_revision
  }
}
```

The `$constraint` query variable has the following structure.

```json
{
  "plan_id": integer,
  "constraint_id": integer,
  "constraint_revision": integer, // optional
  "enabled": boolean, // optional, defaults to true
}
```

The `constraint_revision` field is used to specify which version of the constraint to use when checking constraints.
If absent, the latest version of the constraint will be used.

The `enabled` field controls whether a constraint will be checked.

### Update Constraint Version on a Plan Specification

Excluding the revision will set the plan to use the latest version of the constraint.

```graphql
mutation SetConstraintVersion($planId: Int!, $constraintId: Int!, $constraintVersion: Int) {
  update_constraint_specification_by_pk(
    pk_columns: {plan_id: $planId, constraint_id: $constraintId},
    _set: {constraint_revision: $constraintVersion}
  ) {
    plan_id
    constraint_id
    constraint_revision
    enabled
  }
}
```

### Enable/Disable Constraints on a Plan Specification

Constraints that are disabled will not be checked when checking constraints.

```graphql
mutation SetConstraintVersion($planId: Int!, $constraintId: Int!, $enabled: Boolean!) {
  update_constraint_specification_by_pk(
    pk_columns: {plan_id: $planId, constraint_id: $constraintId},
    _set: {enabled: $enabled}
  ) {
    plan_id
    constraint_id
    constraint_revision
    enabled
  }
}
```

### Remove a Constraint from the Plan Specification

```graphql
mutation RemoveConstraintFromSpec($planId: Int!, $constraintId: Int!) {
  delete_constraint_specification_by_pk(plan_id: $planId, constraint_id: $constraintId) {
    constraint_id
  }
}
```
