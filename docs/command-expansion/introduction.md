# Command Expansion

Aerie provides command expansion capability that can translate a simulated activity into time ordered commands using a rule provided by users.
An expansion rule is provided for an activity type, but applied to all simulated instances of the activity during the expansion.
You can get started by first [uploading a command dictionary](../../command-expansion/upload-command-dictionary).
