# Upload Command Dictionary

To do command expansion Aerie must have a mission model and command dictionary uploaded.
To upload a mission model first complete [the instructions here](../../planning/upload-mission-model) and then return to this page.

To upload a command dictionary in the Aerie UI, open the top-level menu at the upper left corner as shown in the first figure, and navigate to the "Command Expansions" page.
All command dictionaries previously uploaded to Aerie will be listed on this page.
If you would like to upload a dictionary yourself you can click "Choose File" to upload a command dictionary from your local machine.

Aerie only supports [AMPCS command dictionary schema](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/ampcs-dict-schemas/blob/main/CommandDictionary.rnc) standard.
This schema provides a mission name and version in the command dictionary file.
Aerie does not allow uploading the command dictionary files that has the same mission name and version.
