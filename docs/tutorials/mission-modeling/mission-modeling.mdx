# Mission Modeling Tutorial

Welcome Aerie modeling padawans! For your training today, you will be learning the basics of mission modeling in Aerie by building your own simple model of an on-board spacecraft solid state recorder (SSR). This model will track the recording rate into the recorder from a couple instruments along with the integrated data volume over time. Through the process of building this model, you'll learn about the fundamental objects of a model, activities and resources, and their structure. You'll be introduced to the different categories of resources and learn how you define and implement each along with restrictions on when you can/can't modify them. As a bonus, we will also cover how you can make your resources "unit aware" to prevent those pesky issues that come along with performing unit conversions and how you can test your model without having to pull your model into an Aerie deployment.

Let the training begin!

## Prerequisites

### Deploy Aerie

Before we begin writing modeling code, make sure that you have access to an Aerie deployment as we'll be loading our model into Aerie to build plans and view simulation results. You can deploy Aerie locally on your machine by following the simple steps outlined in our [Fast Track](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/introduction/#fast-track) instructions. Once you have checked that the Aerie UI is available on [http://localhost/]([http://localhost/), you should be ready proceed with this tutorial.

### Install an IDE

Aerie mission models are built using a Java modeling framework (which we will discuss in detail later) and take the form of a `.jar` file, which you can then load into Aerie via the UI (or GraphQL API). In order to have an enjoyable experience building your mission model, you'll want to download and install a Java integrated development environment (IDE) with support for the [Gradle Build Tool](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) (our models use Gradle to build our `.jar` files). Our team's preferred IDE is currently [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but any Java IDE should work just fine.

## Download and Build the Mission Model Template

Mission models require a couple of standard items for Aerie to process the model once it has been built:

1. A [`package-info.java`](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/introduction/#the-package-infojava-file) file containing a reference to the top-level mission model class, annotations referencing any activities defined in the model, an annotation referencing a configuration class that can expose configuration parameters that can be varied prior to simulation, and import statements to the Aerie modeling framework to bridge the framework to the model.
2. The top-level [mission model class](https://ammos.nasa.gov/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/introduction/#the-mission-model-class) that defines or delegates the behavior of the system being described in the model. Any quantity or state that you would like to track over the course of the simulation - which we define as a [**Resource**](https://ammos.nasa.gov/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/resources-and-models/) - should be declared and defined in this class or its delegates. The name of the top-level mission class can be anything as long as it matches the reference in `package-info.java`.

Fortunately, to save you some trouble, we've created a [mission model template repository](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template) that already has these items included for you along with a gradle build setup that takes care of including the right Aerie dependencies to get your mission model `.jar` file built hassle-free. In this repository, if you take a look in [`src/main/java/missionmodel`](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template/tree/main/src/main/java/firesat), you'll see the `package-info.java` file along with the top-level `Mission` and `Configuration` classes already defined for you.

On the main page for the [mission model template repository](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template), click the "Use this template" button on the top right of the page and select "Create a new repository" to create a new repository for your SSR model. Clone your new repository and follow the instructions in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template/blob/main/README.md) to setup your environment and test out building a mission model `.jar` from the model. You'll find the `.jar` you built within a `build/libs` directory generated as part of the gradle build.

At this point, we could pull up the Aerie UI and load the `.jar` file into Aerie as a model, but there is nothing really interesting in the model yet. So before we bring our model into Aerie, let's give it some content.

TODO:

- Update mission model template to align with David's new framework
  - Account for his register in the Mission class
  - Update dependencies in build.gradle
  - Change name from firesat to missionmodel
  - Remove activities/resources from the template (If they want content they could use the tutorial repo or other examples we provide)

## Your First Resource

We will begin building our SSR model by creating a single resource, `RecordingRate`, to track the rate at which data is being written to the SSR over time. As a reminder, a **\*Resource** is any measurable quantity whose behavior we want to track over the course of a plan. Then, we will create a simple activity, `CollectData`, that updates the `RecordingRate` by a user-specified rate for a user-specified duration. This activity is intended to represent an on-board camera taking images and writing data to the spacecraft SSR.

Although we could define the `RecordingRate` resource directly in the pre-provided top-level `Mission` class, we'd like to keep that class as simple as possible and delegate most of model's behavior definition to other, more focused classes. With this in mind, let's create a new class within the `missionmodel` package called `DataModel`, which we will eventually instantiate within the `Mission` class.

In the `DataModel` class, declare the `RecordingRate` resource with the following line of code:

```java
    public MutableResource<Discrete<Double>> RecordingRate; // Megabits/s
```

:::tip

As you are coding, take advantage of your IDE to auto import the modeling framework classes you need like `MutableResource`.

:::

Let's tease apart this line of code and use it as an opportunity to provide a brief overview of the various types of resources available to you as a modeler. The mission modeling framework provides two primary classes from which to define resources:

1. `MutableResource` - resource whose value can be explicitly updated by activities or other modeling code after it has been defined. Updates to the resource take the form of "Effects" such as `increase`, `decrease`, or `set`. The values of this category of resource are explicitly tracked in objects called "Cells" within Aerie, which you can read about in detail in the [Aerie Software Design Document](https://ammos.nasa.gov/aerie-docs/overview/software-design-document/#cells) if you are interested.
2. `Resource` - resource whose value cannot be explicitly updated after it has been defined. In other words, these resources cannot be updated via "Effects". The most common use of these resources are to create "derived" resources that are fully defined by the values of other resources (we will have some examples of these later). Since these resources get their value from other resources, they actually don't need to store their own value within a "Cell". Interestingly, the `MutableResource` class extends the `Resource` class and includes additional logic to ensure values are correctly stored in these "Cells".

From these classes, there are a few different types of resources provided, which are primarily distinguished by how the value of the resource progresses between computed points:

- `Discrete` - resource that maintains a constant value between computed points (i.e. a step function or piecewise constant function). Discrete resources can be defined as many different types such as `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Double`, or an enumeration. These types of resources are what you traditionally find in discrete event simulators and are the easiest to define and "effect".
- `Linear` - resource that has a linear profile between computed points. When computing the value of such resources you have to specify both the value of the resource at a given time along with a rate so that the resource knows how it should change until the next point is computed. The resource does not have to be strictly continuous. In other words, the linear segments that are computed for the resource do not have to match up. Unlike discrete resources, a linear resource is implicitly defined as a `Double`.
- `Polynomial` - generalized version of the linear resource that allows you to define resources that evolve over time based on polynomial functions.
- `Clock` - special resource type to provide "stopwatch" like functionality that allows you to track the time since an event occurred.

TODO: Add more content on `Clock`

:::note

Polynomial resources currently cannot be rendered in the Aerie UI and must be transformed to a linear resource (an example of this is shown later in the tutorial)

:::

Looking back at our resource declaration, you can see that `RecordingRate` is a `MutableResource` (we will emit effects on this resource in our first activity) of the type `Discrete<Double>`, so the value of the resource will stay constant until the next time we compute effects on it.

Next, we must define and initialize our `RecordingRate` resource, which we can do in a class constructor that takes one parameter we'll called `registrar` of type `Registrar`. You can think of the `Registrar` class as your link to what will ultimately get exposed in the UI and in a second we will use this class to register `RecordingRate`. But first, let's add the following line to the constructor we just made to fully define our resource.

```java
RecordingRate = resource(discrete(0.0));
```

Both the `MutableResource` and `Discrete` classes have static helper functions for initializing resources of their type. If you included those functions via `import static` statements, you get the simple line above. The `discrete()` function expects an initial value for the resource, which we have specified as `0.0`.

The last thing to do is to register `RecordingRate` to the UI so we can view the resource as a timeline along with our activity plan. This is accomplished with the following line of code:

```java
registrar.discrete("RecordingRate", RecordingRate, new DoubleValueMapper());
```

The first argument to this `discrete` function is the string name of the resource you want to appear in the UI, the second argument is the resource itself, and then the third argument is a [Value Mapper](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-mappers/#value-mappers) object that matches the resource primitive type, which in this case is a `Double`. For now, you don't need to know much about Value Mappers other than they are needed for performing data serialization to the UI and there are mappers already currently available as part of the framework for all basic types. You can create custom ones if you have complex resource types, but for almost all cases, you should be able to get away with one of the pre-built mappers.

You have now declared, defined, and registered your first resource and your `DataModel` class should look something like this:

```java
package missionmodel;

import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.core.MutableResource;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.Registrar;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.discrete.Discrete;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.serialization.mappers.DoubleValueMapper;

import static gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.core.MutableResource.resource;
import static gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.discrete.Discrete.discrete;

public class DataModel {

    public MutableResource<Discrete<Double>> RecordingRate; // Megabits/s

    public DataModel(Registrar registrar) {
        RecordingRate = resource(discrete(0.0));
        registrar.discrete("RecordingRate", RecordingRate, new DoubleValueMapper());
    }
}
```

With our `DataModel` class built, we can now instantiate it within the top-level `Model` class as a member variable of that class. The `Registrar` that we are passing to `DataModel` is unique in that it can log simulation errors as a resource, so we also need to instantiate one of these special error registrars as well. After these additions, the `Mission` class should look like this:

```java
package missionmodel;

import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.Registrar;

public final class Mission {

  public final Registrar errorRegistrar;
  public final DataModel dataModel;

  public Mission(final gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.Registrar registrar, final Configuration config) {
    this.errorRegistrar = new Registrar(registrar, Registrar.ErrorBehavior.Log);
    // Tutorial code
    this.dataModel = new DataModel(this.errorRegistrar);

  }
}
```

## Your First Activity

Now that we have a resource, let's build an activity called `CollectData` that emits effects on that resource. We can imagine this activity representing a camera on-board a spacecraft that collects data over a short period of time. Activities in Aerie follow the general definition given in the [CCSDS Mission Planning and Scheduling Green Book](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/529x0g1.pdf)

> "An activity is a meaningful unit of what can be planned… The granularity of a Planning Activity depends on the use case; It can be hierarchical"

Essentially, activities are the building blocks for generating your plan. Activities in Aerie follow a class/object relationship where [activity types](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-types/introduction/) - defined as a class in Java - describe the structure, properties, and behavior of an object and activity instances are the actual objects that exist within a plan.

Since activity types are classes in Java, create a new class called `CreateData` and add the following Java annotation above that class, which allows Aerie to recognize this class as an activity type.

```java
@ActivityType("CollectData")
```

Within this activity type, let's define two [parameters](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-types/parameters/), `rate` and `duration`, and give them default arguments. When an activity instance is placed into a plan, operators can modify these default arguments prior to simulation if desired. Activity parameters are simply member variables of the activity type class with an annotation above the member variable:

```java
@Export.Parameter
```

:::note

In reality, there are a variety of [parameter annotations](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/parameters/) you can use to tell Aerie about activity parameters and their defaults. In fact, if all member variables are intended to be parameters, you don't even need to include an annotation. For this tutorial, however, we want to be explicit with our parameter definition and will be using annotations even if they aren't technically required.

:::

For our activity, we will make `rate` a `double` with a default value of `10.0` megabits per second and `duration` a `Duration` type built into Aerie with a default value of `1` hour. That translates to the following code:

```java
@Parameter
public double rate = 10.0; // Mbps

@Parameter
public Duration duration = Duration.duration(1, Duration.HOURS);
```

Right now, if an activity of this type was added to a plan, an operator could alter the parameter defaults to any value allowed by the parameter's type. Let's say that due to buffer limitations of our camera, it can only collect data at a rate of `100.0` megabits per second, and we want to notify the operator that any rate above this range is invalid. We can do this with [parameter validations](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-types/parameters/#validations) by adding a method to our class with a couple of annotations:

```java
@Validation("Collection rate is beyond buffer limit of 100.0 Mbps")
@Validation.Subject("rate")
public boolean validateCollectionRate() {
  return rate <= 100.0;
}
```

The `@Validation` annotation specifies the message to present to the operator when the validation fails. The `@Validation.Subject` annotation specifies the parameter(s) with which the validation is associated. Now, as you will see soon, when an operator specifies a data rate above `100.0`, Aerie will show a validation error and message in the UI.

Next, we need to tell our activity how and when to effect change on the `RecordingRate` resource, which is done in an [Activity Effect Model](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-types/effect-model/). Just like with validations, an effect model is built by adding a method to our class, but with a different annotation, `@ActivityType.EffectModel`. Unlike validations, there can only be one of these methods per activity and the method should accept the top-level mission model class as a parameter (which in our case is just `Mission`). Conventionally, the method name given to the effect model is `run()`.

For our activity, we simply want to model data collection at a fixed rate specified by the `rate` parameter over the full duration of the activity. Within the `run()` method, we can add the follow code to get that behavior:

```java
DiscreteEffects.increase(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, this.rate);
delay(duration);
DiscreteEffects.decrease(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, this.rate);
```

Effects on resources are accomplished by using one of the many static methods available in the class associated with your resource type. In this case, `RecordingRate` is a discrete resource, and therefore we are using methods from the `DiscreteEffects` class. If you peruse the static methods in `DiscreteEffects`, you'll see methods like `set()`, `increase()`, `decrease()`, `consume()`, `restore()`,`using()`, etc. Since discrete resources can be of many primitive types (e.g. `Double`,`Boolean`), there are specific methods for each type. Most of these effects change the value of the resource at one time point instantaneously, but some, like `using()`, allow you to specify an [action](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/mission-modeling/activity-types/effect-model/#actions) to run like `delay()`. Prior to executing the action, the resource changes just like other effects, but once the action is complete, the effect on the resource is reversed. These resource effects are sometimes called "renewable" in contrast to the other style of effects, which are often called "consumable".

In our effect model for this activity, we are using the "consumable" effects `increase()` and `decrease()`, which as you would predict, increase and decrease the value of the `RecordingRate` by the `rate` parameter. The `run()` method is executed at the start of the activity, so the increase occurs right at the activity start time. We then perform the `delay()` action for the user-specified activity `duration`, which moves time forward within this activity before finally reversing the rate increase. Since there are no other actions after the rate decrease, we know we have reached the end of the activity.

If we wanted to save a line of code, we could have the "renewable" effect `using()` to achieve the same result:

```java
DiscreteEffects.using(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, -this.rate, () -> delay(duration) );
delay(duration);
```

:::note

For the case where we use `using()`, you'll notice we have to use the `delay()` action twice. This is because the first action within `using()` is spawned, which allows the execution of the effect model to continue as the `using()` effect waits for the end of its `delay()` action. This allows you to have many `using()` effects, perhaps on different resources, running concurrently within an activity. The second `delay()` actually moves time forward for the activity.

:::

With our effect model in place, we are done coding up the `CollectData` activity and the final result should look something like this:

```java
package missionmodel;

import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.discrete.DiscreteEffects;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.annotations.ActivityType;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.annotations.Export.Parameter;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.annotations.Export.Validation;

import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.protocol.types.Duration;

import static gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.ModelActions.delay;
import static gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.protocol.types.Duration.SECONDS;

@ActivityType("CollectData")
public class CollectData {

    @Parameter
    public double rate = 10.0; // Mbps

    @Parameter
    public Duration duration = Duration.duration(1, Duration.HOURS);

    @Validation("Collection rate is beyond buffer limit of 100.0 Mbps")
    @Validation.Subject("rate")
    public boolean validateCollectionRate() {
      return rate <= 100.0;
    }

    @ActivityType.EffectModel
    public void run(Mission model) {

        /*
         Collect data at fixed rate over duration of activity
        */
        // Approach 1 - Modify rate at start/end of activity
        DiscreteEffects.increase(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, this.rate);
        delay(duration);
        DiscreteEffects.decrease(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, this.rate);

    }
}
```

The last thing we need to do before giving our model a test drive is add a line to the `package-info.java` file to help Aerie find our newly built activity type

```java
@WithActivityType(CollectData.class)
```

Ok! Now we are all set to give this a spin.

### Model Test Drive

Within your IDE, compile the model (`./gradlew assemble` should do the trick) and make sure it built successfully by checking `build/lib` for a new `missionmodel.jar` file.

Follow [these instructions](https://ammos.nasa.gov/aerie-docs/planning/upload-mission-model/) to upload your `.jar` file, and give your model a name and version number (e.g. SSR Model version 1.0). Next, you can follow [these instructions](https://ammos.nasa.gov/aerie-docs/planning/create-plan-and-simulate/#instructions) to create a new plan. Pick the model you just compiled to build your plan off of and name your plan `Mission Plan 1` and give it a duration of `1 day`. Click "Create" and click on the newly created plan to open it, which should take you to a view with the plan timeline in the center view panel.

On the left panel, you should see your `CollectData` activity type, which you can drag and drop onto the "Activities" row in the timeline. Your `RecordingRate` resource should also appear as a row in the timeline, but with no values applied yet since we haven't simulated. Put two activities in your plan and click on the second one (the first one we will leave alone and let it use default values). On the right panel, you should now see detailed information about your activity. Look for the "Parameters" section and you will see your rate and duration parameters, which you can modify. Try modifying the rate above `100.0` and you will see a warning icon appear, which you can hover over and see the message we wrote into a Validation earlier. Modify the rate back to `20` and change the default duration to `2 hours`.

:::note

When activity types are initially added to the plan, they are shown with a play button icon and don't have a duration. We call these "activity directives", and it is these activities that you are allowed to modify by changing parameters, timing, etc. Once a simulation has been performed, one or more activities will appear below the directive, which are the activity instances. These actually have a duration (based on their effect model) and are the result of the simulation run.

:::

On the top menu bar, click "Simulation" and then "Simulate". After you see a green checkmark, `RecordingRate` should be populated with a value profile. The value should begin at 0.0 (since we initialized it that way in the model) and pop up to `10` for the first activity and `20` for the second. You'll also see that the activity instances below the activity directives (see note above) have durations that match the arguments we provided. At this point, your view will look similar to the screenshot below.

![Tutorial Plan 1](assets/Tutorial_Plan_1.png)

At this point, we could go into more detail about how you can [edit the timeline](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/planning/timeline-editing/), edit your UI view, or view simulation history, but instead we will move back to our IDE and add some more complexity to our model.

### Enumerated and Derived Resources

In addition to our on-board camera, let's imagine that we also have an instrument on-board that is continuously collecting data, say a magnetometer, based on a data collection mode. Perhaps at especially interesting times in the mission, the magnetometer is placed in a high rate collection mode and at other times remains in a low rate collection mode. For our model, we want to be able to track the collection mode over time along with the associated data collection rate of that mode.

The first thing we'll do to accomplish this is create a Java enumeration called `MagDataCollectionMode` that gives us the list of available collection modes along with a mapping of those modes to data collection rates using [enum fields](https://issac88.medium.com/java-enum-fields-methods-constructors-3a19256f58b). We will also add a getter method to get the data rate based on the mode. Let's say that we have three modes, `OFF`, `LOW_RATE`, and `HIGH_RATE` with values `0.0`, `500.0`, and `5000.0`, respectively. After coding this up, our enum should look like this:

```java
package missionmodel;

public enum MagDataCollectionMode {
    OFF(0.0), // kbps
    LOW_RATE(500.0), // kbps
    HIGH_RATE(5000.0); // kbps

    private final double magDataRate;

    MagDataCollectionMode(double magDataRate) {
        this.magDataRate = magDataRate;
    }

    public double getDataRate() {
        return magDataRate;
    }
}
```

With our enumeration built, we can now add a couple of new resources to our `DataModel` class. The first resource, which we'll call `MagDataMode`, will track the current data collection mode for the magnetometer. Declare this resource as a discrete `MutableResource` of type `MagDataCollectionMode`

```java
public MutableResource<Discrete<MagDataCollectionMode>> MagDataMode;
```

and then add the following lines of code to the constructor to initialize the resource to `OFF` and register it with the UI.

```java
MagDataMode = resource(discrete(MagDataCollectionMode.OFF));
registrar.discrete("MagDataMode",MagDataMode, new EnumValueMapper<>(MagDataCollectionMode.class));
```

As you can see, declaring and defining this resource was not much different than when we built `RecordingRate` except instead of referencing the `Double` type, we are referencing our enumerated type `MagDataCollectionMode`.

Another resource we can add is one to track the numerical value of the data collection rate of the magnetometer, which is based on the collection mode. In other words, we can derive the value of the rate from the mode. Since we are deriving this value and don't intend to emit effects directly onto this resource, we can declare it as a discrete `Resource` of type `Double` instead of a `MutableResource`.

```java
public Resource<Discrete<Double>> MagDataRate; // bps
```

When we go to define this resource in the constructor, we need to tell the resource to get its value by mapping the `MagDataMode` to its corresponding rate. A special static method in the `DiscreteResourceMonad` class called `map()` allows us to define a function that operates on the value of a resource to get a derived resource value. In this case, that function is simply the getter function we added to the `MagDataCollectionMode`. The resulting definition and registration code for `MagDataRate` then becomes

```java
MagDataRate = map(MagDataMode, MagDataCollectionMode::getDataRate);
registrar.discrete("MagDataRate", MagDataRate, new DoubleValueMapper());
```

:::note

Instead of deriving a resource value from a function using `map()`, there are a number of static methods in the `DiscreteResources` class, which you can use to `add()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, etc. resources. For example, you could have a `Total` resource that simple used `add()` to sum some resources together.

:::

### Using Current Value in an Effect Model

- Create simple activity, ChangeMagMode, to change instrumentB mode, which in turn will change its data rate
  - This shows how you can get the current value of resource and use it for computation

### Second Look

- Compile and load the model into Aerie again for a second look
  - Put both types of activities in plan and see how it changes the two rate resources and how mode is tracked
  - ![Tutorial Plan 2](assets/Tutorial_Plan_2.png)

### Integrating Data Rate

- Create SSR volume resource

  - Talk about the various methods for integrating
  - Method 1 - Increase volume at end of activity

  - Method 2 - Increase volume across fixed number of steps within the activity

  - Note why these methods get more challenging with a mode based approach (integral is being tracking in the activity class and therefore activity needs to get track of the time since the mode changed, which isn't really something an activity should know/care about)

  - Method 3 - Reaction based approach

  - Method 4 - Daemon approach

  - Method 5 - Polynomial resource

- Create downlink activity that decreases recording rate at some point for more interesting looking plots

- How to show decomposition?? Maybe a calibration that decomposes into CollectData?

- Update Rate/SSR_Volume to Unit Aware Resources

- Show setting up tests (unit/simulation)
