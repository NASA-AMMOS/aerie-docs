# Using Current Value in an Effect Model

Now that we have our magnetometer resources, we need to build an activity that changes the `MagDataMode` for us (since `MagDataRate` is a derived resource, we shouldn't have to touch it) and changes the overall SSR `RecordingRate` to reflect the magnetometer's data rate change. This activity, which we'll call `ChangeMagMode`, only needs one parameter of type `MagDataCollectionMode` to allow the user to request a change to the mode. Let's give that parameter a default value of `LOW_RATE`.

In the effect model for this activity (which we'll call `run()` by convention), we can use the `set()` method in the `DiscreteEffects` class to change the `MagDataMode` to the value provided by our mode parameter. The computation of the change to the `RecordingRate` caused by the mode change is a little tricky because we need to know both the value of the `MagDataRate` before and after the mode change. Once we know those value, we can subtract the old value from the new value to get the net increase to the `RecordingRate`. If the new value happens to be less than the old value, our answer will be negative, but that should be ok as long as we use the `increase()` method when effecting the `RecordingRate` resource.

We can get the current value of a resource with a static method called `currentValue()` available in the `Resources` class. For our case here, we want to get the current value of the `MagDataRate` **before** we actually change the mode to the requested value, so we have to be a little careful about the order of operations within our effect model. The resulting activity type and its effect model should look something like this:

```java
package missionmodel;

import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.modeling.discrete.DiscreteEffects;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.annotations.ActivityType;
import gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.framework.annotations.Export;

import static gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.contrib.streamline.core.Resources.currentValue;

@ActivityType("ChangeMagMode")
public class ChangeMagMode {

    @Export.Parameter
    public MagDataCollectionMode mode = MagDataCollectionMode.LOW_RATE;

    @ActivityType.EffectModel
    public void run(Mission model) {
         double currentRate = currentValue(model.dataModel.MagDataRate);
         double newRate = mode.getDataRate();
         // Divide by 10^3 for kbps->Mbps conversion
         DiscreteEffects.increase(model.dataModel.RecordingRate, (newRate-currentRate)/1.0e3);
         DiscreteEffects.set(model.dataModel.MagDataMode, mode);
    }
}
```

Looking at our new activity definition, you can see how we use the `increase()` effect on `RecordingRate` to "increase" the data rate based on the net data change from the old rate. You may also notice a magic number where we do a unit conversion from `kbps` to `Mbps`, which isn't ideal. Later on in this tutorial, we will introduce a "Unit Aware" resource framework that will help a bit with conversions like these if desired.

As a final step, make sure you add this new activity to our `package-info.java` file

```java
@WithActivityType("ChangeMagMode.class")
```
