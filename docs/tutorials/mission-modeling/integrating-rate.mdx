# Integrating Data Rate

Now is where the fun really begins! Although having the data rate in and out of our SSR is useful, we are often more concerned with the total amount of volume we have in our SSR in order to make sure we don't over fill it and have sufficient downlink opportunities to get all the data we collected back to Earth. In order to compute total volume, we must figure out a way to integrate our `RecordingRate`. It turns out there are many different methods in Aerie you can choose to arrive at the total SSR volume, but each method has its own advantages and drawbacks. We will explore 4 different options for integration with the final option, a derived `Polynomial` resource, being our recommended approach. As we progress through the options, you'll learn about a few more features of the resource framework that you can use for different use cases in your model including the use of `Reactions` and **daemon** tasks.

## Method 1 - Increase volume within activity

The simplest method for performing an "integration" of `RecordingRate` is to compute the integral directly within the effect model of the activities who change the `RecordingRate`. Before we do this, let's make sure we have a data volume resource in our `DataModel` class. For each method, we are going to build a different data volume resource so we can eventually compare them in the Aerie UI. As this is our simplest method, let's call this resource `SSR_Volume_Simple` and make it store volume in Gigabits (Gb). Since we are going to directly effect this resource in our activities, this will need to be a `MutableResource`. The declaration looks just like `RecordingRate`

```java
public MutableResource<Discrete<Double>> SSR_Volume_Simple; // Gigabits
```

as does the definition, initialization, and registration in the constructor:

```java
SSR_Volume_Simple = resource(discrete(0.0));
registrar.discrete("SSR_Volume_Simple", SSR_Volume_Simple, new DoubleValueMapper());
```

Taking a look at our `CollectData` activity, we can add the following line of code after the `delay()` within its effect model (`run()` method) to compute the data volume resulting from the activity collecting data at a constant duration over the full duration of the activity.

```java
DiscreteEffects.increase(model.dataModel.SSR_Volume_Simple,this.rate*duration.ratioOver(SECONDS)/1000.0);
```

This line will increase `SRR_Volume_Simple` at the end of the activity by `rate` times `duration` divided by our magic number to convert `Mb` to `Gb`. Note that the `duration` object has some helper functions like `ratioOver` to help you convert the `duration` type to a `double` value.

There are a few notable issues with this approach. The first issue is that when a plan is simulated, the data volume of the SSR will only increase at the very end of the activity even though in reality, the volume is growing linearly in time throughout the duration of the activity. If your planners only need this level of fidelity to do their work, this may be ok. However, if your planners need a little more fidelity during the time span of the activity, you could spread out the data volume accumulation over many steps. That would look something like this in code,

```java
int numSteps = 20;
Duration step_size = Duration.divide(duration, numSteps);
for (int i = 0; i < numSteps; i++) {
  delay(step_size);
  DiscreteEffects.increase(model.dataModel.SSR_Volume_Simple,this.rate*step_size.ratioOver(SECONDS)/1000.0);
}
```

which would replace the `delay()` and the single data volume increase line from above. The resulting timeline for `SSR_Volume_Simple` would look like a stair step with the number of steps equal to `numSteps`. It's important to remember we are still using a `Discrete` resource, so the resource is stored as a constant, "step-function" profile in Aerie. We will show the use of a `Polynomial` resource in our final method to truly store and view data volume as a linear profile.

Another issue with this approach is that is does not transfer well to activities like `ChangeMagMode` that alter the `RecordingRate` and do not return the rate back to its original value at the end of the activity (i.e. activities whose effects on rate are not contained within the time span of the activity). In order to compute the magnetometer's contribution to the data volume in `ChangeMagMode`, we would need to multiply the `currentRate` by the duration since the last mode change, or if no mode change has occurred, the beginning of the plan. While this is possible by using a `Clock` resource to track time between mode changes, the `ChangeMagMode` activity would now requires additional context about the plan that would otherwise be unnecessary.

A third issue to note is that the computation of `RecordingRate` and `SSR_Volume_Simple` are completely separate, and both of them live within the activity effect model. In reality, these quantities are very much related and should be tied together in some way. The relationship between rate and volume is activity independent, and thus it makes more sense to define that relationship in our `DataModel` class instead of the activity itself.

Given these issues, we will hold off on implementing this approach for `ChangeMagMode` and move forward to trying out our next approach.

## Method 2 - Sample-based volume update

Another method to integration we can take is a numerical approach where we compute data volume by sampling the value of the `RecordingRate` at a fixed interval across the entire plan. In order to implement this method, we can `spawn()` a simple task from our top-level `Mission` class that runs in the background while the plan is being simulated, which is completely independent of activities in the plan. Such tasks are known as `daemon` tasks, and your mission model can have an arbitrary number of them.

Before we create this task, let's add another discrete `MutableResource` of type `double` called `SSR_Volume_Sampled` to the `DataModel` class. Just as with other resources we have made, the declaration will look like

```java
public MutableResource<Discrete<Double>> SSR_Volume_Sampled; // Gigabits
```

and the definition, initialization, and registration in the constructor will be

```java
SSR_Volume_Sampled = resource(discrete(0.0));
registrar.discrete("SSR_Volume_Sampled", SSR_Volume_Sampled, new DoubleValueMapper());
```

In addition to the resource, let's add another member variable to specify the sampling interval we'd like for our integration. Choosing `60` seconds will result in the follow variable definition

```java
private final Duration INTEGRATION_SAMPLE_INTERVAL = Duration.duration(60, Duration.SECONDS);
```

Staying in the `DataModel` class, we can can create a member function called `integrateSampledSSR` that has no parameters, which we will spawn from the `Mission` class shortly. For the sake of simplicity, we will define this function to take the "right" Reimann Sum (a "rectangle" rule approximation) of the `RecordingRate` over time. The implementation of this function looks like this:

```java
public void integrateSampledSSR() {
  while(true) {
    delay(INTEGRATION_SAMPLE_INTERVAL);
    Double currentRecordingRate = currentValue(RecordingRate);
    DiscreteEffects.increase(SSR_Volume_Sampled, currentRecordingRate *
    INTEGRATION_SAMPLE_INTERVAL.ratioOver(Duration.SECONDS) / 1000.0); // Mbit -> Gbit
  }
}
```

As a programmer, you may be surprised to see an infinite `while` loop, but Aerie will shut down this task, effectively breaking the loop, once the simulation reaches the end of the plan. Within the loop, the first thing we do is `delay()` by our sampling interval and then retrieve the current value of `RecordingRate`. Finally, we sum up our rectangle by multiplying the current rate by the sampling interval. We could have easily chosen to use other numerical methods like the "trapezoid" rule by storing the previous recording rate in addition to the current rate, but what we did is sufficient for now.

The final piece we need to build into our model to get this method to work is a simple `spawn` with the `Mission` class to our `integrateSampledSSR` method.

```java
spawn(dataModel::integrateSampledSSR);
```

The issues with this approach to integration are probably fairly apparent to you. First of all, this approach is truly an approximation, so the resulting volume may not be the actual volume if the sampled points don't align perfectly with the changes in `RecordingRate`. Secondly, the fact we are sampling at a fixed time interval means we could be computing many more time points than we actually need if the recording rate isn't changing between time points. If you were to try to scale up this approach, you might run into performance issues with your model where simulation takes much longer than it needs to.

Despite these issues `daemon` tasks are a very effective tool in a modelers tool belt for describing "background" behavior of your system. Examples for a spacecraft model could include the computation of geometry, battery degradation over time, environmental effects, etc.

## Method 3 - Update volume upon change to rate

If you are looking for an efficient, yet accurate way to compute data volume from `RecordingRate`, one method you could take is to set up trigger that calls a function whenever `RecordingRate` changes and then computes volume by multiplying the rate just before the latest change by the duration that has passed since the last change. Fortunately, there is a fairly easy way to do this in Aerie's modeling framework.

Let's begin by creating one more discrete `MutableResource` called `SSR_Volume_UponRateChange` in our `DataModel` class (refer back to previous instances in this tutorial for how to declare and define one of these). In addition to our volume resource, we are also going to need a `Clock` resource to help us track the time between changes to `RecordingRate`. Since this resource is more of a "helper" resource and doesn't need to be exposed to our planners, we'll make it `private` and not register it to the UI. Declaring and defining a `Clock` resource is not much different than declaring a `Discrete` except you don't have to specify a primitive type. The declaration looks like this

```java
private MutableResource<Clock> TimeSinceLastRateChange;
```

and the definition in the constructor looks like this

```java
TimeSinceLastRateChange = resource(Clock.clock(Duration.ZERO));
```

This will start a "stopwatch" right at the start of the plan so we can track the time between the start of the plan and the first time `RecordingRate` is changed. We'll also need one more member variable of type `Double`, which we'll call `previousRate` to keep track of the previous value of `RecordingRate` for us.

```java
private Double previousRecordingRate = 0.0;
```

Our next step is to build our trigger to react when there is a change to `RecordingRate`. We can do this by leveraging the `wheneverUpdates()` static method available within the framework's `Reactions` class

```java
Reactions.wheneverUpdates(RecordingRate, this::uponRecordingRateUpdate);
```

:::note

The `Reactions` class has a couple more static methods that a modeler may find useful. The `every()` method allows you to specify a duration to call a recurring action (we could have used this instead of our `spawn()` for the sampled integration method). The `whenever()` method allows you to specify a `Condition`, which when met, would trigger an action of your choosing. An example of a condition could be when a resource reaches a certain threshold.

:::

As you can see, this method takes a resource as its first argument and some `Runnable`, like a function call, as it's second argument. We have specified that the function `uponRecordingRateUpdate` be called, so now we have to implement that function within our `DataModel` class. The implementation of that function is below, which we will walk through line by line.

```java
public void uponRecordingRateUpdate() {
  // Determine time elapsed since last update
  Duration t = currentValue(TimeSinceLastRateChange);
  // Update volume only if time has actually elapsed
  if (!t.isZero()) {
    DiscreteEffects.increase(this.SSR_Volume_UponRateChange,
    previousRecordingRate * t.ratioOver(Duration.SECONDS) / 1000.0); // Mbit -> Gbit
  }
  previousRecordingRate = currentValue(RecordingRate);
  // Restart clock (set back to zero)
  ClockEffects.restart(TimeSinceLastRateChange);
}
```

When the `RecordingRate` resource changes, the first thing we do is determine how much time has passed since it last changed (or since the beginning of the plan). If no time has passed, we don't want to re-integrate and double count volume, but if time has passed, we do our simple integration by multiplying the previous rate by the elapsed time since the value of rate changed. We then store the new value of rate as the previous rate and restart our stopwatch to we get the right time next time the rate changes.

And that's it! Now, every time `RecordingRate` changes, the SSR volume will update to the correct volume. However, the volume is still a discrete resource, so volume will only change as a step function at time points where the rate changes. Nonetheless, since `RecordingRate` is piece-wise constant, you'll get the right answer for volume with no error at those time points.

## Method 4 - Derived volume from polynomial resource

We have finally arrived at the final method we'll go through for integrating `RecordingRate`, and in some ways, this one is the most straightforward. We will define our data volume as polynomial resource, `SSR_Volume_Polynomial`, which we can build by using an `integrate()` static method provided by the `PolynomialResources` class. As a polynomial resource, we will actually see the volume increase linearly over time as opposed to in discrete chunks. Since `SSR_Volume_Polynomial` will be derived directly from `RecordingRate`, we can make this a `Resource` as opposed to a `MutableResource`. The declaration of our new resource looks like this

```java
public Resource<Polynomial> SSR_Volume_Polynomial;  // Gigabits
```

while the definition and registration in the constructor of our `DataModel` class look like this

```java
SSR_Volume_Polynomial = scale(
    PolynomialResources.integrate(asPolynomial(this.RecordingRate), 0.0), 1e-3); // Gbit
registrar.real( "SSR_Volume_Polynomial", PolynomialResources.assumeLinear(SSR_Volume_Polynomial));
```

Breaking down the definition, we see the `integrate()` function takes the resource to integrate as the first argument, but that argument requires the resource to be polynomial as well. Fortunately, there is a static method in `PolynomialResources` called `asPolynomial()` that can convert discrete resources like `RecordingRate` to polynomial ones. The second argument is the initial value for the resource, which we have been assuming is `0.0` for data volume. The `integrate()` function is then wrapped by `scale()`, another handy static method in `PolynomialResources` to convert our resource from `Megabit` to `Gigabit`.

The resource registration is also slightly different than what we have seen thus far as we are using a `real()` method as opposed to `discrete()` and we have to wrap our resource with yet another static helper method in `PolynomialResources` called `assumeLinear()`. The reason we have to do this is that the UI currently does not have support for `Polynomial` resources and can only render timelines as linear or constant segments. In our case, `SSR_Volume_Polynomial` is actually linear anyway, so we are not "degrading" our resource by having to make this down conversion.

Now in reality, our on-board `SSR` is going to have a max capacity, and if data is removed from the `SSR`, we want to make sure our model stops decreasing the `SSR` volume once it reaches `0.0`. By good fortune, the Aerie framework includes another static method in `PolynomialResources` called `clampedIntegral()` that allows you to build a resource that takes care of all that messy logic to make sure you are adhering to your min/max limits.

If we wanted to build a "clamped" version of `SSR_Volume_Polynomial`, it would look something like this

```java
var clampedIntegrate = PolynomialResources.clampedIntegrate( scale(
    asPolynomial(this.RecordingRate), 1e-3),
    PolynomialResources.constant(0.0),
    PolynomialResources.constant(250.0),
    0.0);
SSR_Volume_Polynomial = clampedIntegrate.integral();
```

The second and third arguments of `clampedIntegrate()` are the min and max bounds for the integral and the final argument is the starting value for the resource as it was in `integrate()`. The `clampedIntegrate()` method actually returns a `record` of three resources:

- integral – The clamped integral value (i.e. the main resource of interest)
- overflow – The rate of overflow when the integral hits its upper bound. You can integrate this to get cumulative overflow.
- underflow – The rate of underflow when the integral hits its lower bound. You can integrate this to get cumulative underflow.

As expected, the `integral()` resource is mapped to `SSR_Volume_Polynomial` to complete its definition.
