# External Events Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will provide a brief overview of External Events in Aerie in a walkthrough format. Extensive details on what External Events, External Sources, and Derivation Groups are can be found under at [External Events planning](../../../planning/external-events) section.

## Prerequisites

External events are a component similar to Activities and Resources within Aerie, and as such requires a deployment of Aerie. Additionally, to interact with the external events in a plan's context, a mission model must be created (though as of now, there is no connection between anything related to external events and mission models, so any mission model should be fine).

You can deploy Aerie locally on your machine by following the simple steps outlined in our [Fast Track](../../../introduction/#fast-track) instructions.

After you've confirmed the Aerie UI is available on [http://localhost/](http://localhost) and a mission model has been uploaded, you should be ready to proceed with this tutorial.
