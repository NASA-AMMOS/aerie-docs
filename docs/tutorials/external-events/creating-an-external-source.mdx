# Creating an External Source
We are going to manually create two External Sources and upload them to Aerie. They will be slightly staggered in the times they cover to help us later in illustrating how derivation works.

Create the following JSON files in an editor:

`External_Events_Demo_00.json`:
```

    "source": {
        "key": "External_Events_Demo_00.json",
        "source_type": "DemoType",

`External_Events_Demo_01.json`:

    },
    "events": [

            "duration": "03:00:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

We are now ready to upload our test External Source files to Aerie!

**Note**: In each of these files, the exact formatting of event keys is currently not important.

More details can be found in the [External Events](../../../planning/external-events/) section.
