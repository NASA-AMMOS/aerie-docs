# Uploading the External Source
Having created our sources, we are now able to upload them. Assuming you have deployed an instance of Aerie, navigate to the External Sources page:

<figure>
  <img alt="Click 'External Sources' button" src={externalEventsTutorialUploadStep1} />
</figure>

Once here, we can now upload our new External Sources. Click the **'Browse...'** button, and select the first file, `External_Events_Demo_00.json`. The upload section should autofill as follows:

<figure>
  <img alt="Click the 'Browse...' button and select the first test file - uploaded file form should become populated" src={externalEventsTutorialUploadStep2} />
  <figcaption><i>Uploaded file form should become populated</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Go ahead and leave the `Derivation Group` as `DemoType Default`.

Finally, click upload. The new External Source should show in the table on the right:

<figure>
  <img alt="External Sources table is populated" src={externalEventsTutorialUploadStep3} />
</figure>

Click the 'x' next to 'Selected External Source' to deselect it, then repeat these steps with the second file. The table should now look as follows:

<figure>
  <img alt="External Sources table is populated with both test files" src={externalEventsTutorialUploadStep4} />
</figure>

We can now see both external sources we've uploaded in the top-right table, and the external events of the selected source (in this case, the 2nd example file as it's the last we uploaded) in the bottom-right table.

We are now ready to associate our new Derivation Group (`DemoType Default`) with a plan!
