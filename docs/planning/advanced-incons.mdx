# Advanced - Incons

If you have previously run simulation on a plan, it is possible to use that simulation data to initialize resources in a later simulation run.
This can be useful when running [Temporal Subset Simulation](../create-plan-and-simulate#advanced-temporal-subset-simulation),
or if one plan's input is dependent on the output of another.

In order to take advantage of this feature, the Mission Model must be written to support loading incons from a file.

:::info Note

The instructions on this page are designed to work with the example Mission Model changes provided [here](../../mission-modeling/advanced-incons).
They may need to be tweaked slightly depending on how your model implemented incon loading.

:::

### Step 1: Get the Incons from Hasura

Navigate to your deployment's Hasura GraphQL console by selecting `GraphQL Console` in the dropdown under `Aerie`.
By default, the GraphQL console is accessible on [port 8080](http://localhost:8080).

  />

In the Hasura GraphiQL console of your deployment, enter [the following query](/api/examples/simulation/#query-for-simulation-resource-data-at-a-given-time):

```graphql
query GetResources($dataset_id: Int!, $start_offset: interval!) {
  getResourcesAtStartOffset(args: { _dataset_id: $dataset_id, _start_offset: $start_offset }) {
    id
    dataset_id
    dynamics
    is_gap
    name
    start_offset
    type
  }
}
```

In the `Query Variables` field below, enter a JSON that specifies the id of the simulation dataset to use,
and how far into the results you'd like to get results, in the format `hh:mm:ss`.
For example, the following sample JSON would get the values of all previously set resources four days into the thirteenth simulation:

```json
{
  "dataset_id": 13,
  "start_offset": "96:00:00"
}
```

The simulation dataset ID can be found in the `Simulation History` section of the Simulation pane.

:::caution

If the first time a resource's value is set is after `start_offset`, it will not appear in the returned list of resources.

### Step 2: Export and Upload the Incons

Take the value of `"getResourcesAtStartOffset"` from the output of the query and copy it into a JSON file.

Next, navigate to your deployment's Gateway by selecting `Gateway` in the dropdown under `Aerie`.
By default, the Gateway is accessible on [port 9000](http://localhost:9000).

  <img alt="Aerie UI - Dropdown Menu Highlighting Gateway Option" src={gatewayDropdown} style={{ maxHeight: '50vh' }} />
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Dropdown Menu Highlighting Gateway Option</figcaption>
</figure>

Scroll down to `Files` and select [`POST /file`](http://localhost:9000/#/Files/post_file).
Click the `Try it out` button.
In the `x-auth-sso-token` field, enter your auth token if you have one, or, if auth is disabled, enter `unknown`.
If you do not know your auth token, you can get it by logging in using the [`POST /auth/login`](http://localhost:9000/#/Auth/post_auth_login) action.
Click the `browse` button next to file and select the JSON with the incons.

Click the `Execute` button. In `ServerResponse`, you should see a response body that looks like:

```json
{
  "file": {
    "fieldname": "file",
    "originalname": "incons.json",
    "encoding": "7bit",
    "mimetype": "application/json",
    "destination": "files",
    "filename": "incons-1682384407286-7ouftKBnfPWs93.json",
    "path": "files/incons-1682384407286-7ouftKBnfPWs93.json",
    "size": 2539
  },
  "id": 8
}
```

The most important element of this JSON is `filename`. It contains the name of the file within Aerie.

### Step 3: Use the Incons in Simulation

Finally, open the Simulation Configuration panel and set the `inconsPath` argument to `<path-to-aerie-file-store>/<filename>`,
where `<path-to-aerie-file-store>` is the path to where the `aerie_file_store` volume is mounted in Merlin,
and `<filename>` is the value of `"filename"` from the earlier JSON from the Gateway.

By default, `<path-to-aerie-file-store>` is `merlin_file_store`.
