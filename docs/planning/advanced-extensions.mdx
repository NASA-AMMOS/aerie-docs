# Advanced - Extensions

Extensions are external tools that can be invoked directly from inside of Aerie. When an Extension is called, the following values are passed along in the request body:

- `gateway` - The URL for the current instance's Gateway server.
- `hasura` - The URL for the current instance's Hasura server.
- `planId` - The id of the plan the user is looking at.
- `selectedActivityDirectiveId` - The id of the selected activity directive (if applicable).
- `simulationDatasetId` - The id of the last run simulation (if applicable).

Additionally, the user's current session information will be passed to the Extension via the `Authorization` and `x-hasura-role` headers.

Extensions **must** return a response of the following form:

- `message`: the message to be displayed as a notification inside of Aerie
- `success`: a boolean indicating whether the Extension ran successfully
- `url`: an optional link to a file or website. if provided, it will be opened in a new tab

## Managing Extensions

Extensions may only be managed via the [GraphQL API](/api/examples/advanced-extensions).

## Using Extensions

When looking at a plan in Aerie, all registered Extensions can be found under the Navbar entry between Scheduling and View.
If there are no any extensions registered, this entry will be hidden.

Hovering over extensions will bring up the list of registered Extensions.
To run an extension, click on its entry in the list.
