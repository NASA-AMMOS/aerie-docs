# Upload Mission Model

Here we describe how to upload a mission model to Aerie using the [Aerie UI](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui).
This document assumes you already have the Aerie services running somewhere (either locally or remotely).
To get the Aerie services running locally first follow the [fast track instructions](../../introduction#fast-track) and then come back here.

## Instructions

1. First develop your mission model using the [mission modeling documentation](../../mission-modeling/introduction). If you want to learn how to develop a mission model, head to our [mission modeling tutorial](../../tutorials/mission-modeling/introduction). If you do not want to develop a mission model and just want to try an example, you can download the [missionmodel.jar](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-modeling-tutorial/blob/main/missionmodel.jar) from the [Aerie modeling tutorial repository](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-modeling-tutorial). Make sure you note where you downloaded the `.jar` file as you will need to browse to that location in the UI.

1. Navigate to the `/models` page in the Aerie UI. If you are running Aerie locally it is at [http://localhost/models](http://localhost/models).

1. Use the form on the `/models` page to upload the mission model `.jar` file. Give the mission model a name ("MissionModel" in this example). The version can be any string (preferably a semantic version string like `1.0.0`). After you fill in all the fields click the 'Create' button to upload the model. Here is a video demonstration:

     <source src={uploadMissionModel} type="video/webm" />
