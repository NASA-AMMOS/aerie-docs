# Introduction

This section of documentation summarizes the results of the Aerie testing process. Here we will outline the testing process that was conducted, describe the testing environment and setup, and present the results of the tests. We will also provide an analysis of the results and discuss any issues that were identified during the testing process. Finally, we will make recommendations for further testing or improvements based on the findings of this report.

# Purpose

The purpose of a test report is to communicate the results of a testing effort to stakeholders, such as project managers, developers, and QA teams. It is an important tool for evaluating the quality of a product and identifying any issues that need to be addressed for a release.

# Scope

This test report covers tests implemented and executed in the [Aerie](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie) and [Aerie UI](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui) repositories. Within both both repositories we execute both unit tests and end-to-end tests.
