# Project Repositories

Repositories within the Aerie project ecosystem are assigned a status (via a badge) to help set user expectations on the maturity and stability of the code within each repository.
These statuses and their definitions are below:

[![Repo Status - Prototype](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Prototype-violet)](https://) - Intended to test out a new concept or design. Not intended as production code. Rapid development with no guaranteed stability and limited testing.

[![Repo Status - Incubating](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Incubating-yellow)](https://) - Early stages of a repo eventually intended for production. Ongoing development with no guaranteed stability and limited testing.

[![Repo Status - Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Development-brightgreen)](https://) - Middle stage of a repo working towards production. Active development with some testing and stability, but limited documentation.

[![Repo Status - Production](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Production-blue)](https://) - Established repository with robust testing and documentation. Developers are building new releases, responding to issues, and integrating code contributions while maintaining stability with breaking changes noted in release notes.

[![Repo Status - Not Maintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Not_Maintained-red)](https://) - Repository with no active development or maintenance to ensure compatibility with other project repositories. Still may have value to users or developers and could potentially be revived given additional resources or an identified need.

[![Repo Status - Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo_Status-Deprecated-lightgrey)](https://) - Repository that has being phased out of production and no longer recommended for use
