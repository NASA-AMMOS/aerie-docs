# Constraints

When analyzing simulation results, it may be useful to detect windows where certain conditions are met.
Constraints are the Aerie tool for fulfilling that role.
A constraint is a condition on activities and resources that must hold through an entire simulation.
If a constraint does not hold true at any point in a simulation, this is considered a violation.

## Managing

All constraints are associated with either a mission model or a specific plan.
If associated with a model, a constraint will be applied to all plans made with that model.
If associated with a plan, it will only applied to the plan, and it will have access to any [external datasets](../../planning/external-datasets) associated with the plan as well.
