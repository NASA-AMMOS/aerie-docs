# Goals

This document describes different scheduling goals available in Aerie and how to author them using the TypeScript EDSL.

:::caution

Activities with [uncontrollable durations](../../mission-modeling/activity-types/parameters#duration-types) have been found to behave somewhat unpredictably in terms of when they are placed.
This has to do with how temporal constraints interact with the unpredictability of the durations.
Finding when an activity will start while subject to temporal constraint involves search.

:::

## ActivityTemplate

An `ActivityTemplate` specifies the type of an activity, as well as the arguments it should be given.
Activity templates are generated for each mission model.
You can get the full list of activity templates by typing `ActivityTemplates.` (note the period) into the scheduling goal editor, and viewing the auto-complete options.

If the activity has parameters, pass them into the constructor in a dictionary as key-value pairs. For example:

```ts
ActivityTemplate.ParamActivity({ param: 1 });
```

If the activity has no parameters, do not pass a dictionary. For example:

```ts
ActivityTemplate.ParameterlessActivity();
```

## Goal Types

### Activity Recurrence Goal

The Activity Recurrence Goal (sometimes referred to as a "frequency goal") specifies that a certain activity should occur repeatedly throughout the plan at some given interval.

#### Inputs

- `activityTemplate` - The description of the activity whose recurrence we're interested in
- `interval` - A [Temporal.Duration](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html) of time specifying how often this activity must occur

#### Behavior

The `interval` is treated as an upper bound - so if the activity occurs more frequently, that is not considered a failure.
The scheduler will find places in the plan where the given activity has not occurred within the given interval, and it will place an instance of that activity there.

:::note

The interval is measured between the start times of two activity instances. Neither the duration, nor the end time of the activity are examined by this goal.

:::

#### Examples

The following goal will place a `GrowBanana` activity in every 2-hour period of time that does not already contain one with the exact same parameters.

```ts
export default function recurrenceGoalExample() {
  return Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
      quantity: 1,
    }),
    interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 }),
  });
}
```

### Coexistence Goal

The Coexistence Goal specifies that a certain activity should occur once **for each** occurrence of some condition.

#### Inputs

- `forEach` - A set of time `Windows`, or a set of activities (`ActivityExpression`)
- `activityTemplate` - The description of the activity to insert after each activity identified by `forEach`
- `startsAt` - Optionally specify a specific time when the activity should start relative to the window
- `startsWithin` - Optionally specify a range when the activity should start relative to the window
- `endsAt` - Optionally specify a specific time when the activity should end relative to the window
- `endsWithin` - Optionally specify a range when the activity should end relative to the window

:::note

Either the start or end of the activity must be constrained.
This means that at least 1 of the 4 properties `startsAt`, `startsWithin`, `endsAt`, `endsWithin` must be given.

:::

#### Behavior

The scheduler will find places in the plan where the `forEach` condition is true, and if not, it will insert a new instance using the given `activityTemplate` and temporal constraints.

#### Examples

The following example specifies a `CoexistenceGoal` where for each activity "A" of type `GrowBanana` present in the plan, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` starting exactly at the end of "A" + 5 minutes:

```ts
export default () =>
  Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
    forEach: ActivityExpression.ofType(ActivityTypes.GrowBanana),
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({ peelDirection: 'fromStem' }),
    startsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 })),
  });
```

This next example specifies a `CoexistenceGoal` where for each activity "A" of type `GrowBanana` present in the plan, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` starting in the interval [end of "A", end of "A" + 5 minutes] and ending in the interval [end of "A", end of "A" + 6 minutes]:

```ts
export default () =>
  Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
    forEach: ActivityExpression.ofType(ActivityTypes.GrowBanana),
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({ peelDirection: 'fromStem' }),
    startsWithin: TimingConstraint.range(WindowProperty.END, Operator.PLUS, Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 })),
    endsWithin: TimingConstraint.range(WindowProperty.END, Operator.PLUS, Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 6 })),
  });
```

This final example specifies a `CoexistenceGoal` where for each continuous period of time during which the `/fruit` resource is equal to `4`, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` ending exactly at the end of "A" + 6 minutes:

```ts
export default () =>
  Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
    forEach: Real.Resource('/fruit').equal(4.0),
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({ peelDirection: 'fromStem' }),
    endsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 })),
  });
```

Note that the scheduler will allow a default timing error of 500 milliseconds for temporal constraints.
This parameter will be configurable in an upcoming release.

:::caution

If the end is unconstrained while the activity has an [uncontrollable duration](../../mission-modeling/activity-types/parameters#duration-types), the scheduler may fail to place the activity.
To work around this, add an `endsWithin` constraint that encompasses your expectation for the duration of the activity - this will help the scheduler narrow the search space.

:::

### Cardinality Goal

The Cardinality Goal specifies that a certain activity should occur in the plan either a certain number of times, or for a certain total duration.

#### Inputs

- `activityTemplate` - The description of the activity whose recurrence we're interested in
- `specification` - An object with either an occurrence field, a duration field, or both (see examples below)

#### Behavior

The duration and occurrence are treated as lower bounds - so if the activity occurs more times, or for a longer duration, that is not considered a failure, and the scheduler will not add any more activities.

The scheduler will identify whether or not the plan has enough occurrences, or total duration of the given activity template.
If not, it will add activities until satisfaction.

#### Examples

The following example is a `CardinalityGoal` that sets a lower bound on the total duration:

```ts
export default function cardinalityGoalExample() {
  return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      quantity: 1,
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
    }),
    specification: { duration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 10 }) },
  });
}
```

This next example specifies a `CardinalityGoal` that sets the lower bound on the number of occurrences:

```ts
export default function cardinalityGoalExample() {
  return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      quantity: 1,
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
    }),
    specification: { occurrence: 10 },
  });
}
```

Finally we combine the previous two examples:

```ts
export default function cardinalityGoalExample() {
  return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      quantity: 1,
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
    }),
    specification: { occurrence: 10, duration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 10 }) },
  });
}
```

:::note

In order to avoid placing multiple activities at the same start time, the `CardinalityGoal` introduces an assumed mutual exclusion constraint - namely that new activities will not be allowed to overlap with existing activities.

:::

### OR Goal - Disjunction of Goals

The OR Goal aggregates several goals together and specifies that at least one of them must be satisfied.

#### Inputs

- `goals` - A list of goals (here below referenced as the sub-goals)

#### Behavior

The scheduler will try to satisfy each sub-goal in the list until one is satisfied.
If a sub-goal is only partially satisfied, the scheduler will not backtrack and will let the inserted activities in the plan.

#### Examples

The following example shows how to use the `.or` operator on a pair of goals.
If the plan has a 24-hour planning horizon, the `OR` goal below will try placing activities of the `GrowBanana` type.
The first sub-goal will try placing 10 1-hour occurrences.
If it fails to do so, because the planning horizon is too short, it will then try to schedule 1 activity every 2 hours for the duration of the planning horizon.

It may fail to achieve both sub-goals but as the scheduler does not backtrack for now, activities inserted by any of the sub-goals are kept in the plan.

```ts
export default function orGoalExample() {
  return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      quantity: 1,
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
    }),
    specification: { occurrence: 10 },
  }).or(
    Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
      activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
        quantity: 1,
        growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
      }),
      interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 }),
    }),
  );
}
```

### AND Goal - Conjunction of Goals

The AND Goal aggregates several goals together and specifies that at least one of them must be satisfied.

#### Inputs

- `goals` - A list of goals (here below referenced as the sub-goals)

#### Behavior

The scheduler will try to satisfy each sub-goal in the list.
If a sub-goal is only partially satisfied, the scheduler will not backtrack and will let the inserted activities in the plan.
If all the sub-goals are satisfied, the AND goal will appear satisfied.
If one or several sub-goals have not been satisfied, the AND goal will appear unsatisfied.

#### Examples

The AND goal below has two sub-goals.
The `CoexistenceGoal` will place activities of type `PeelBanana` every time the `/fruit` resource is equal to 4.
The second `CardinalityGoal` will place 10 occurrences of the `PeelBanana` activity.

The first sub-goal will be evaluated first and will place a certain number of `PeelBanana` activities in the plan.
When the second goal is evaluated, it will count already present `PeelBanana` activities and insert the missing number.

Imagine the first goals leads to inserting 2 activities.
The second goal will then have to place 8 activities to be satisfied.

```ts
export default function andGoalExample() {
  return Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
    forEach: Real.Resource('/fruit').equal(4.0),
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({ peelDirection: 'fromStem' }),
    endsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 })),
  }).and(
    Goal.CardinalityGoal({
      activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({ peelDirection: 'fromStem' }),
      specification: { occurrence: 10 },
    }),
  );
}
```

## Restricting When a Goal is Applied

By default, a goal applies on the whole planning horizon.
The Aerie scheduler provides support for restricting when a goal applies with the `.applyWhen()` method in the `Goal` class.
This node allows users to provide a set of `Windows` which could be a time-based, or a resource-based window.

The `.applyWhen()` method, takes one argument: the windows (in the form of an expression) that the goal should apply over.
Below is an example that applies a daily recurrence goal only when a given resource is greater than 2.
If the resource is less than two, then the goal is no longer applied.

```ts
export default function applyWhenExample() {
  return Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
    activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
      quantity: 1,
      growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
    }),
    interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 }),
  }).applyWhen(Real.Resource('/fruit').greaterThan(2));
}
```

## Goal Boundary Exclusivity

Note if you are trying to schedule an activity, or a recurrence within a window but that window cuts off either the activity or the recurrence interval (depending on the goal type), it will not be scheduled.
For example, if you had a recurrence interval of 3 seconds, scheduling a 2 second activity each recurrence, and had the following window, you'd get the following:

```txt
RECURRENCE INTERVAL: [++-++-++-]
GOAL WINDOW:         [+++++----]
RESULT:              [++-------]
```

That, is, the second activity won't be scheduled as the goal window cuts off its recurrence interval.
Scheduling is _local_, not global. This means for every window that is matched (as it is possible to have disjoint windows, imagine a resource that fluctuates upward and downward but only applying that goal when the resource is over a certain value), the goal is applied individually.
So for that same recurrence interval setup as before, we could have:

```txt
RECURRENCE INTERVAL: [++-++-++-++-]
GOAL WINDOW:         [+++++--+++--]
RESULT:              [++-----++---] // (the second one is applied independently of the first!)
```

When mapping out a temporal window to apply a goal over, keep in mind that the ending boundary of the goal is exclusive, i.e. if I want to apply a goal in the window of 10-12 seconds, it will apply only on seconds 10 and 11.
This is in line with the [fencepost problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error).

## Creating a New Goal

This section describes how to create a new scheduling goal via the Aerie UI. In the UI, open the scheduling pane by clicking on the top-right bar.

import schedulingPanel from './assets/scheduling-panel.png';

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Aerie UI - Scheduling Panel" src={schedulingPanel} />
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Aerie UI Scheduling Panel</figcaption>
</figure>

Next click "New" to create a new scheduling goal in the specification for the plan you are viewing. This will open the goal editor.
