# Effect Model

Every activity type has an associated "effect model" that describes how that activity impacts mission resources. An effect model is a method on the activity type class annotated with `@EffectModel`; there can only be one such method per activity type.

By convention the decorated effect model function is named `run`, and it accepts the top-level `Mission` model as a parameter. This method is invoked when the activity begins, paused when the activity waits a period of time, and resumes when that period of time passes.

The activity’s computed duration will be measured from the instant this method is entered, and extends either until the method returns or until all spawned children of the activity have completed – whichever is longer.

## Exceptions

If an uncaught exception is thrown from an activity’s effect model, the simulation will halt. No later activities will be performed, and simulation time will not proceed beyond the instant at which the exception occurred. As such, uncaught exceptions are essentially treated as fatal errors.

We advise mission models to employ uncaught exceptions sparingly, as it deprives planners of information about the behavior of the spacecraft after the fault. An uncaught exception will cause the simulation to abort without producing any results – not even up to the point of failure. On the other hand, uncaught exceptions may be useful to identify bugs in the mission model or situations that the mission model is not intended to simulate.

## Actions

An activity’s effect model may wait for time to pass, spawn other activities, and affect spacecraft state. Spacecraft state is affected via the `Mission` model parameter, which depends on the details of the modeled mission systems.

Actions related to the passage of simulation time are provided as static methods on the `ModelActions` class:

1. `delay(duration)` - Delay the currently-running activity for the given duration. On resumption, it will observe effects caused by other activities over the intervening timespan.

1. `waitUntil(condition)` - Delay the currently-running activity until the provided `Condition` becomes true. On resumption, it will observe effects caused by other activities over the intervening timespan.

Actions related to spawning other activities are provided by the generated `ActivityActions` class, usually found under the generated package within your codebase:

1. `spawn(activity)` - Spawn a new activity as a child of the currently-running activity at the current point in time. The child will initially see any effects caused by its parent up to this point. The parent will continue execution uninterrupted, and will not initially see any effects caused by its child.

1. `call(activity)` - Spawn a new activity as a child of the currently-running activity at the current point in time. The child will initially see any effects caused by its parent up to this point. The parent will halt execution until the child activity has completed.

For example, consider a simple activity for running the on-board heaters called `RunHeater`:

```java
@ActivityType("RunHeater")
public final class RunHeater {
  private static final int energyConsumptionRate = 1000;

  @Parameter
  public long durationInSeconds = 0;

  @EffectModel
  public void run(final Mission mission) {
    spawn(new PowerOnHeater());

    final double totalEnergyUsed = durationInSeconds * energyConsumptionRate;
    mission.batteryCapacity.set(totalEnergyUsed);

    delay(durationInSeconds, Duration.SECONDS);

    call(new PowerOffHeater());
  }
}
```

This activity first spawns a `PowerOnHeater` activity, which then continues concurrently with the current `RunHeater` activity. Next, the total energy to be used by the heater is subtracted from the remaining battery capacity (see the [Resources and Models documentation](../../resources-and-models/introduction)). The energy used depends on the duration parameter of the activity, allowing the activity’s effect to be tuned by the planner. Next, the activity waits for the desired heater runtime to elapse, then spawns and waits for a `PowerOffHeater` activity. The activity completes after both children have completed.

## Activity Decomposition

In Aerie mission models, decomposition of an activity is not an independent method, rather it is defined within the effect model by means of invoking child activities. These activities can be invoked using the `call()` method, where the rest of the effect model waits for the child activity to complete; or using the `spawn()` method, where the effect model continues to execute without waiting for the child activity to complete. This method allows any arbitrary serial and parallel arrangement of child activities. This approach replaces duration estimate based wait calls with event based waits. Hence, this allows for not keeping track of estimated durations of activities, while also improving the readability of the activity procedure as a linear sequence of events.

## Computed Attributes

Upon the termination of an Activity, the effect model can optionally log some information that will be included with the simulation results. This information has no effect on the current simulation, but can be used by downstream tools that process the simulation results.

To specify the information that will be logged, the mission modeler must change the return type of the method marked with the `@EffectModel` annotation.

For the `RunHeater` example from above the effect model return type is `void`, which means no useful information will be logged. Let’s define a record type to house our computed attributes, and update the effect model to return it:

```java
@AutoValueMapper.Record
record ComputedAttributes(
  long durationInSeconds;
  int energyConsumptionRate;
) {}

@EffectModel
public ComputedAttributes run(final Mission mission) { // Notice the new return type.
  spawn(new PowerOnHeater());

  final double totalEnergyUsed = durationInSeconds * energyConsumptionRate;
  mission.batteryCapacity.set(totalEnergyUsed);

  delay(durationInSeconds, Duration.SECONDS);

  call(new PowerOffHeater());

  return new ComputedAttributes(durationInSeconds, energyConsumptionRate);
}
```

The `@AutoValueMapper.Record` annotation exists to make this pattern more convenient - it only applies to records returned from effect models.

Computed attributes are not limited to records - they can be any type that Aerie knows how to serialize. Here is an example where the effect model returns a list of strings, instead of a record:

```java
@EffectModel
public List<String> run(final Mission mission) {
  final var logs = new ArrayList<String>();

  spawn(new PowerOnHeater());
  logs.add("Spawned PowerOnHeater");

  final double totalEnergyUsed = durationInSeconds * energyConsumptionRate;
  mission.batteryCapacity.set(totalEnergyUsed);
  logs.add("Total energy used: " + totalEnergyUsed);

  logs.add("Delaying for " + durationInSeconds + " seconds");
  delay(durationInSeconds, Duration.SECONDS);

  call(new PowerOffHeater());

  return logs;
}
```
