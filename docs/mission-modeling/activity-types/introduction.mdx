# Activity Types

An **activity type** defines a simulated behavior that may be invoked by a planner, separate from the autonomous behavior of the mission model itself.
Activity types may define **parameters**, which are filled with **arguments** by a planner and provided to the activity upon execution.
Activity types may also define **validations** for the purpose of informing a planner when the parameters they have provided may be problematic.

For example, here is a simple activity type from the FireSat template mission model:

<RemoteCodeBlock
  language="java"
  showLineNumbers
  title="Aerie Mission Model Template (FireSat) - GncChangeControlMode.java"
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-mission-model-template/main/src/main/java/firesat/activities/gnc/GncChangeControlMode.java"
></RemoteCodeBlock>

Aerie automatically generates parameter serialization boilerplate for every activity type defined in the mission model's [package-info.java](../introduction.mdx#the-package-infojava-file).
Moreover, the generated Model base class provides helper methods for spawning each type of activity as children from other activities.

## Activity Type Annotations

In order for Aerie to detect an activity type, its class must be annotated with the `@ActivityType` tag. An activity type is declared with its name using the following annotation:

```java
@ActivityType("GncChangeControlMode")
```

By doing so, the Aerie annotation processor can discover all activity types declared in the mission model, and validate that activity type names are unique.

## Activity Type Metadata

Metadata of activities are structured such that the Aerie annotation processor can extract this metadata given particular keywords. Currently, the annotation processor recognizes the following tags: `contact`, `subsystem`, `brief_description`, and `verbose_description`.
These metadata tags are placed in a [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) style comment block above the activity type to which they refer. For example:

```java
/**
 * @subsystem Data
 * @contact camargo
 * @brief_description A data management activity that deletes old files
 */
 @ActivityType("DeleteOldFiles")
```
