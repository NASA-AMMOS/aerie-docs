# Advanced Topic - Activity Mappers

An Activity Mapper is a Java class that implements the `ActivityMapper` interface for the `ActivityType` being mapped.
It is required that each Activity Type in an mission model have an associated Activity Mapper to provide several capabilities surrounding serialization/deserialization of activity instances.

The default annotation processor can automatically be generated for every activity type, even for those with custom-typed parameters.
This document explains how to create a custom activity mapper interface if it is needed.

## ActivityMapper Interface

The `ActivityMapper` interface is shown below:
