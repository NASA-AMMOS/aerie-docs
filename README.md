# Aerie Documentation

This is the main documentation site for Aerie.

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

### Local Development

```sh
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```sh
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
